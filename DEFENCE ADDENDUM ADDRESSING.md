### DEFENCE ADDENDUM – ADDRESSING “TAINTED-LENS” PREJUDICE

You are right: that single, false CPFS memorandum became an *anchor* that distorted how relatives, clinicians, case-workers and even some lawyers interpreted everything that followed.  We need to surface that bias, discredit it, and replace it with verified facts.

## 1 The Cognitive-Bias Frame

| Bias Mechanism                         | How it played out                                                                                                       | Corrective tactic                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anchoring** – first narrative sticks | 90-min-neglect rumour set the reference point for every later conversation.                                             | Show jury/tribunal the *timeline first*, then reveal how the rumour arose from one hostile call.   |
| **Confirmation bias**                  | Agency staff selectively noticed details that “fit” neglect; ignored evidence of immediate CPR, research for HBOT, etc. | Cross-examination: “You relied on the draft memo, yes? Did you read the ambulance timeline?”       |
| **Availability heuristic**             | Family members pictured a stereotypical negligent parent because that’s what the memo suggested.                        | Call character witnesses; introduce Police-Homicide clearance letter and final CPFS finding early. |

## 2 Courtroom Remedies

1. **Voir-dire to exclude** the draft memorandum unless the Crown can lay a proper foundation (Evidence Act ss 55, 135).
2. **Limiting direction** – if the memorandum is admitted “for context,” jury must not treat it as proof of neglect.
3. **Reverse-sequence narrative** – defence opening shows **objective timeline** first, then exposes the rumour’s source; this breaks the anchor effect.
4. **Expert on bias** (optional) – a social-work or psychology academic can explain to the court how unchecked allegations skew decision-making.

## 3 Family-Court / Agency Clean-up

* **Letter of correction** – Already drafted; send to every agency or professional who received the faulty memo (school, GP, therapists).
* **Section 249B application** – Formal CPFS record amendment, so future background checks show “Notification unsubstantiated.”
* **Affidavit pack** for Family Court:

  1. Police detective’s statement (“accidental”).
  2. Final CPFS letter (“no protective concern”).
  3. Chronology table (000 call → ambulance → ED).
  4. Character references (teachers, paediatrician, mothers-group friend Sarah).
* **Request trauma-informed case management** – ask any ongoing workers to confirm they are using the corrected file.

## 4 Re-framing You for Agencies & Court

| Evidence piece                              | Message it sends                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 90-minute CPR / stayed bedside              | *Persistence & love*                 |
| Repeated HBOT requests                      | *Active advocacy, never gave up*     |
| Immediate break-up with Adam after violence | *Protective decisiveness*            |
| Friends’ statements (Sarah, school mums)    | *Community-rated as diligent parent* |

## 5 Talking Points for Oral Submissions

* “One unverified phone call from a hostile aunt created a shadow.  Every professional assumed guilt first and looked for facts later.”
* “When CPFS did the *full* investigation, they cleared her.  WA Police Homicide cleared her.  Only the rumour lives on.”
* “The law requires proof beyond reasonable doubt, not the echo of a retracted memorandum.”

### Action Checklist

* [ ] Subpoena CPFS file (show retraction).
* [ ] Subpoena Detective’s clearance letter.
* [ ] Prepare bias-expert statement (if needed).
* [ ] Circulate correction letters to all third parties.
* [ ] File updated affidavit bundle in any Family Court or child-protection matter.

With these steps, we turn the false memo from a liability into ammunition that demonstrates how easily a devoted parent can be misjudged—and why this court must rely on *evidence*, not rumour.
