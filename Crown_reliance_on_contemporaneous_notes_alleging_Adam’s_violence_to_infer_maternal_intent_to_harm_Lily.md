### SUPPLEMENTARY DEFENCE SUBMISSION

*(Re Crown reliance on contemporaneous notes alleging Adam’s violence to infer maternal intent to harm Lily)*

---

#### 1 Context of the Writings

The statements the mother recorded—detailing:

* school-parent reports that **Adam physically hurt Joshua (age 6, diagnosed anxiety);**
* Adam’s **infidelity** and unprotected sex;
* an incident where Adam, intoxicated, **forced a door onto the mother’s arm while she cradled Lily**,

were written **to document domestic-violence episodes and to seek safety planning advice**.

#### 2 Why the Notes Do **Not** Support Intent to Harm Lily

| Crown contention                                                               | Defence response                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Hostile writings show motive against Adam that could extend to harming child” | Domestic-violence literature recognises **victim safety-journaling** (Sharps & Laughon 2019).  Recording abuse is a *protective* act, not a violent impulse.        |
| “Mother was pre-occupied with Adam’s misconduct, distracting her”              | The notes are retrospective; they were *not* drafted in the critical three-minute window.  No causal link to bath supervision.                                      |
| “Mentions of Adam’s physical abuse prove a climate of violence”                | Violence was **perpetrated by Adam**, not by the mother.  The writings show her *efforts to shield the children* and eject Adam from the house.                     |
| “Seeking external support = intent to shame, ergo malice”                      | Help-seeking is recommended by WA Police Family Violence Code of Practice.  The law must not convert a **protected disclosure** into evidence of criminal mens rea. |

---

#### 3 Evidentiary Principles

* **Hoch v R**: propensity evidence inadmissible if an innocent explanation exists.  Here, the innocent explanation is *safety documentation*.
* **Bauer** & **Shamouil**: material of marginal probative value and high prejudice must be excluded (Evidence Act 1906 ss 97, 135).
* **Family Violence Best-Practice** (WA): courts must avoid **“victim-blaming inferences”** when a parent documents abuse.

---

#### 4 Positive Inferences Favouring the Mother

1. **Protective Behaviour** – She *kicked Adam out*, sought peer/parent support, and kept written record—actions consistent with safeguarding, not endangerment.
2. **Risk-Aware Parenting** – She monitored Joshua’s anxiety, responded to school reports, and physically shielded Lily during Adam’s assault.
3. **Absence of Retaliation** – Despite repeated provocation, there is **no incident of the mother harming either child**.

---

#### 5 Precedent Alignment

*In re* **TPL** (WA 2013) and **Master K** (Vic 2021) the caregivers also experienced severe stressors, yet the coroner expressly held that **external stress does not establish foreseeability or intent** absent reckless conduct.

---

#### 6 Conclusion

The writings are **victim-advocacy evidence**.  They:

* **Refute**, rather than support, any suggestion the mother would harm Lily;
* Demonstrate a **pattern of protection** against Adam’s violence;
* Are, at best, background narrative with negligible probative weight concerning the charged offence.

**Prayer**: exclude the documents under ss 55, 97 & 135, or direct the jury that they cannot be used to infer intent or negligence regarding Lily’s death.
