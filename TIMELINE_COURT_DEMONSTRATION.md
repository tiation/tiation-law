# TIMELINE COURT DEMONSTRATION: Physical Proof of One-Minute Timeline

## Physical Setup Requirements

### 1. Floor Layout Demonstration

Using colored tape on courtroom floor, mark exact distances:
- RED tape: Toilet to Joshua's room (3.1m)
- BLUE tape: Joshua's room to bathroom (5.2m)
- GREEN tape: Bathroom entrance to tub (1.8m)

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Place markers for walls and doorways using cardboard stands
2. Mark actual toilet position with chair
3. Place bath-height platform at exact tub location
4. Position bathroom step (12.7cm height) at documented location

### 2. Timing Equipment

- Large digital display timer (visible to jury)
- Video camera for real-time recording
- Stopwatch for backup timing

## Live Demonstration Sequence

### Demonstration 1: Adult Movement Speed (30 seconds)

1. Position demonstrator at toilet location
2. Start timer
3. Walk at normal pace (1.4 m/s) through marked path
4. Show total time on display (should be 5.9 seconds)
5. Repeat three times to show consistency

### Demonstration 2: Child Movement Time (1 minute)

Using child-sized test dummy:
1. Position at Joshua's room start point
2. Demonstrate crawling speed (0.3 m/s)
3. Show time to reach bathroom (17.3 seconds)
4. Demonstrate step climbing using dummy
5. Show total possible time to reach tub

### Demonstration 3: Full Distance Perspective (2 minutes)

Have jury members:
1. Walk the exact distances themselves
2. Time their own walking speed
3. Physically see that 10.1 meters cannot take multiple minutes
4. Experience actual line-of-sight limitations

## Physical Evidence Demonstrations

### 1. Bathtub Access Demonstration (2 minutes)

Using actual measurements from review_drowning.jpeg:
1. Show tub height (45.7cm)
2. Place step (12.7cm) in position
3. Demonstrate reduced climbing height (33cm)
4. Use test dummy to show climbing capability
5. Time climbing sequence

### 2. Water Level and Drainage (3 minutes)

Using clear container with scale markings:
1. Show water level marks from scene photo
2. Demonstrate standard drain rate
3. Time drainage with stopwatch
4. Show how 4-6 minute drain time aligns with evidence

## Timeline Anchor Points Demonstration

### 1. Emergency Response Sequence (2 minutes)

Using emergency call recording and paramedic records:
1. Play actual 000 call audio (7:40 AM timestamp)
2. Show ambulance arrival photo (7:52 AM)
3. Display scene photo timestamp (8:12 AM)
4. Demonstrate working backward from these fixed points

### 2. Physical Activity Duration Demo (3 minutes)

Live demonstration of minimum times:
1. Time typical toilet use (30 seconds minimum)
2. Time hand washing (10-15 seconds)
3. Time walking distances (5.9 seconds)
4. Time search and discovery sequence (5-7 seconds)

## Composite Timeline Demonstration

### Real-Time One-Minute Recreation (5 minutes)

Full-speed demonstration with timer display:
1. Start: Demonstrator at toilet (0:00)
2. Show dummy movement during toilet use
3. Time parent emerging (0:30)
4. Time discovery and movement (0:35-0:45)
5. Time reaching bathroom (0:50-0:55)
6. Show total time under one minute

## Interactive Jury Demonstration

### 1. Distance and Time Experience (10 minutes)

Have jury members:
1. Walk the measured distances
2. Time their own movement speeds
3. Attempt the movements in under 2 minutes
4. Experience the physical impossibility of a longer timeline

### 2. Line of Sight Demonstration (5 minutes)

Have jury members:
1. Sit in toilet position
2. Attempt to view bathroom location
3. Experience actual visual limitations
4. Understand physical constraints

## Visual Aids

### 1. Synchronized Video Display

Split-screen showing:
- Left: Real-time demonstration
- Right: Running timer
- Bottom: Distance measurements

### 2. Physical Evidence Display

Mounted boards showing:
1. Floor plan with measurements
2. Scene photos with timestamps
3. Emergency response records
4. Timeline reconstruction

## Equipment Requirements

### 1. Measurement Tools
- Professional laser measure
- Tape measures
- Distance markers
- Angle measures for sight lines

### 2. Demonstration Props
- Child-sized test dummy
- Bathroom step replica (12.7cm)
- Tub height platform (45.7cm)
- Drainage demonstration container

### 3. Documentation Equipment
- Video cameras
- Large display timer
- Audio system for call playback
- Photo display screens

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Pre-Court Setup (2 hours needed)
1. Measure and mark all distances
2. Position all barriers and markers
3. Test all timing equipment
4. Rehearse demonstrations
5. Verify all measurements

### 2. During Trial Setup (30 minutes needed)
1. Place floor markers
2. Position demonstration equipment
3. Set up timing displays
4. Test sight lines
5. Verify all measurements again

## Safety and Protocol Notes

1. All demonstrations performed at safe speeds
2. Clear paths for jury movement
3. Stable platforms for all equipment
4. Multiple verification of measurements
5. Backup timing systems ready
