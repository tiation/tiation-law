# Key Legal Precedents Supporting Ms. Jeffery's Defense

## Western Australia Cases

### 1. *Coroner's Court of WA – Child B Drowning (2019)*
- **Facts:** Toddler drowned in filling bath while parent was distracted
- **Outcome:** No prosecution recommended
- **Finding:** Deemed a tragic accident, not a criminal act
- **Relevance to Jeffery Case:** Similar circumstance of brief distraction during bath filling

### 2. *Coroner's Court of WA – Inquest into the death of TPL (2013)*
- **Facts:** Child gained access to hazard in a different room down a hallway during brief parental lapse
- **Outcome:** No criminal liability found
- **Finding:** Brief lapses do not satisfy foreseeability when the hazard is in a separate room
- **Relevance to Jeffery Case:** Directly analogous to Lily accessing bathroom down the hallway

### 3. *State v SME (WA, 2017)*
- **Facts:** Child drowned in pond during brief lapse in supervision
- **Outcome:** Court found no criminal negligence
- **Finding:** Harm was not foreseeable
- **Relevance to Jeffery Case:** Supports argument that brief, unforeseeable accidents do not constitute criminal negligence

## Interstate Cases (Supporting Precedent)

### 4. *Master K (Vic 2021)*
- **Facts:** 
  - 2-3 minute lapse in supervision
  - Parent within 2 meters, distracted by phone
  - No prior risk history
- **Outcome:** No charge, deemed accidental death
- **Relevance to Jeffery Case:** Almost identical timeline (≤3 min) and circumstances

### 5. *R v Patel (Qld, 2022)*
- **Principle:** Tragic outcome does not equal criminal liability unless there is gross negligence
- **Finding:** Criminal negligence requires a gross departure from reasonable care
- **Relevance to Jeffery Case:** Brief visibility lapse while supervising two children does not meet the "gross departure" standard

### 6. *Baby L (QLD 2015)*
- **Facts:** Brief, unintentional supervision lapse
- **Outcome:** Ruled accidental
- **Relevance to Jeffery Case:** Factually similar to our circumstances

### 7. *Child Z (QLD 2014)*
- **Facts:** Brief supervision lapse
- **Outcome:** Ruled accidental
- **Relevance to Jeffery Case:** Factually similar to our circumstances

## Contrasting Cases (Distinguished from Jeffery Case)

### 8. *R v Gallagher (2022) QSC 183*
- **Facts:** Prolonged, conscious absence (7-30 minutes) for non-essential activity
- **Outcome:** Found liable
- **Distinction from Jeffery Case:** Our case involves only 1-2 minutes while using the toilet (essential activity)

### 9. *R v Murray (2023) QSC 47*
- **Facts:** Prolonged, conscious absence for non-essential activity
- **Outcome:** Found to be a gross departure from ordinary care
- **Distinction from Jeffery Case:** Our case involves only 1-2 minutes while using the toilet (essential activity)

## Legal Principles to Emphasize

1. **Brief lapses in otherwise attentive parenting do not constitute criminal negligence**
   - Supported by TPL (2013), Master K (2021)

2. **Foreseeability is not established when:**
   - The child has no history of accessing the hazard
   - The parent maintains proximate supervision
   - The lapse is measured in seconds, not minutes
   - Supported by State v SME (2017)

3. **Tragic outcome does not equal criminal liability**
   - Supported by R v Patel (2022)

4. **Criminal negligence requires a gross departure from reasonable care**
   - Brief visibility lapse while supervising two children does not meet this standard
   - Supported by R v Patel (2022)

## Conclusion

The precedents consistently show that brief, unintentional lapses in supervision resulting in tragic accidents do not constitute criminal negligence. Cases with similar fact patterns to Ms. Jeffery's have consistently been ruled as accidents rather than criminal acts. The prosecution's reliance on cases involving prolonged, conscious absences (Gallagher, Murray) is misplaced, as those cases are factually distinguishable from the present matter.
