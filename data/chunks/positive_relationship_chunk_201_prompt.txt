Text: There is no disrespect here Louisa. You are acting selfish right now, it's like you want me to suffer in my life, no car, no name on the lease. There are no sides to be taken here, I have not chosen a side and how dare you say that I'm being disrespectful to the kids when I'm trying to do everything right by them by making sure we have enough resources for them and us. 

This relationship is not working between you and I. I can't make any decisions that I know will benefit us more. I can't take the kids to see anyone in my own it's like you have to supervise or something with the kids which is ridiculous
