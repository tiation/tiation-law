You knew that message would have reactions that weren't going to be in your favour. I'm sorry that this happened and even when it did happen I still stayed with you Louisa. \n\nI have not lied about you to my family. I don't know where you are getting this from but it is not true. \n\nI did not assault you Louisa. We were both in a tight space and I wanted to get through it and you to stood in the way. I apologise that I bumped you into you and wasn't my intention as I thought you were going to move out the way. \n\nI didn't want to leave at all. You had put me in a situation where I have zero choice for both the kids, you state to me that I'm a parent yet you take the choices that parents have for kids away from me. I did not feel like part of the family unit at all Lou. You told me that getting a free car to help me, to help us, to help the family work together would be disrespectful. It doesn't matter where I was getting the car or who I was getting it from. I was looking at the bigger picture so that our family could be more functional especially between you and I but you did not see that. \n\nI don't know what to do with us...I love you Louisa and I always will and I love the kids and I do want to see them BOTH.
