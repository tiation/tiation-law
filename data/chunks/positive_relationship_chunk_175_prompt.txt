Text: Well according to my Aunty I don't think I was invited Louisa. I could be wrong but that was the interpretation I got. You didn't send me the message that you had sent my Aunty Louisa, I remember you showing me the one message that I thought was appropriate that was actually addressing the issues at hand, it was brining anything up from 40-50 years ago. That was the message you shouldn't have sent because it wasn't relevant, what is bringing up events from so long ago going to change? It's not like we can turn back time and stop it from happening.
