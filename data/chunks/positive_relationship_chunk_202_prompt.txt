Text: There is no cooperation with you, when everything started with my family, yes I did cut everyone off from my family, I chose YOUR side I had blocked everyone for us. As I had done this, you then started to tell me things that made me feel like I was nothing, that I wasn't a parent, that everything I was doing as a parent was wrong. You made me feel alone, unsupported and useless to the family unit.

Text: I just don't get why this has happened to Lily. How you could let this happen to Lily, if you couldn't handle Lily you should've told me and I would've had her myself. You obviously because of what's happened, couldn't handle Lily and now Lily is the one who suffers in life. It's fucking unfair it's so unfair.

Text: What you are asking for, your demands, is ridiculous Louisa. We are going to go through court because you're making me out like I'm 100% a total bad person in this world, you don't take responsibility for anything, you've done no wrong to anyone, you are acting childish and you cannot ever be civilised because of something doesn't go your way then there is no other way.

Keywords: good
Text: Who says though Lou? I hate explaining myself to people who are not good, it's a waste of my time, my effort and my life. I'm going to ignore people who are abusive and condone abuse. My silence to them is all they deserve, why should I give them more? Why do I need to make them feel satisfied with my reasons? They don't. No one has done it to you, no one has done it to me. Did Ali send you messages and explain himself to you? Did he give you the time to explain himself for his actions?

Sentiment: negative (score: -0.94)
Text: I don't even know why I bother with you. I ask a simple question about when you want to see Lily next, you just then flip it around and it make it all about abuse. You are an abusive person Louisa, you are one of the most abusive people I have ever met in my life.

Keywords: understand
Text: But that's not my job Louisa, I'm not a police officer, I'm not a detective and I'm not judge, jury or executioner. What you're saying for me to do is ridiculous and I'm over it. Do you not understand that I've been fighting my whole life and I'm so tired of it, I'm tired of arguing I'm done. You want things in life that have nothing to do with you, it wasn't even in your timeline of existence.
