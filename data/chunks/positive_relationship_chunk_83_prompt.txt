
You are analyzing text messages for evidence that could support a legal defense case.
Focus specifically on identifying evidence of Positive Relationships.

Look for messages that demonstrate:
- Evidence of love
- Evidence of care
- Evidence of trust
- Evidence of respect
- Evidence of support
- Evidence of help
- Evidence of appreciate
- Evidence of thank
- Evidence of sorry
- Evidence of good

For each message, provide:
1. A brief assessment of how it shows Positive Relationships
2. Key phrases or words that serve as evidence
3. How this could support the defense case

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on Positive Relationships in your analysis.

--- MESSAGE 1 ---
Date: 2022-07-16 07:19:00
From: 61488180171
Direction: incoming
Sentiment: neutral (score: 0.03)
Keywords: understand,well,hope
Text: There is no case here. I don't even understand how this conversation has even started, you have now made my simple first message: 'Hi Louisa. Hope you and the kids are going well.' into a conversation about my behaviour and my entitlement. 

I no longer want to continue this conversation with you because all it's doing is going back and forth and I'm over it. You can say whatever you want Louisa, I'm not here to change your mind or pull you up on your behaviour that's not my responsibility. 

Again, I will see you on Tuesday at the car park for the court case at 9:15am as you stated on your previous messages. Which court will this be at?
