Text: Okay Michael gives you $900 or something every month and you've stated the doesn't always pay it. I pay half your rent and your wifi for your house $380 x 2 = $760 and $90. Which equals up to $850 a month and I work casually and I'm a full time student, I don't earn over a 100k a year but I still pay $850 a month to for you and the kids to continue living in Mosman Park and having internet and I don't complain one bit about that. 

You may say it's low all you want but you forget my situation and the things I already pay for you. It is really not my responsibility to pay for yours and Joshua's health insurance, Joshua's health insurance should be 100% discussed with you and Michael.
