Text: Joshua and Michael spoke about the sloth
Then Joshua brought up that he has the coronavirus 
Joshua then stated to Michael that he doesn't get enough presents from Michael, the reason why Joshua stated this is because he can't see him this week so he needs 2 presents
Joshua then told Michael to tell his cousins that he can't see him
Michael then asked Joshua what his symptoms were and Joshua said he had a sore throat and a cough
The conversation then was just about the coronavirus and how the vaccine doesn't work
Michael then asked if Adam was there and Joshua said that I am there and that I have coronavirus too 
Michael then brought up if Joshua asked about a sleepover in which Joshua didn't say anything about the sleepover and Michael then apologised to Joshua for bringing it up
From there, the conversation was about how Joshua can't go anywhere because of the coronavirus 
There was a long pause 
Joshua then talked about building forts together 
Michael then brought up to Joshua that they should get a drone and go fishing together with the drone and will get a special drone for fishing 
Joshua then said he can bring it back to his family's house but Michael said no as the drone would be "his house" toy only 
Michael then brought up that he can fix anything as Joshua said to him that his old drone is busted 
Michael then stated that he is going to go now and will talk to him on Thursday
