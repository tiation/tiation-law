Text: It is spelt 'pedophile'. You state that your dad is a pedophile. Your dad visits with your mum. Joshua has behavioural issues and as soon as he fixes that he can visit, if you must know I arrange with Michael (Joshua's actual dad) to visit on Saturday but Joshua had refused get ready or do anything to visit Lily proving my point that Joshua has issues, so Joshua did not visit due to his attitude and behaviour.
