
You are analyzing text messages for evidence that could support a legal defense case.
Focus specifically on identifying evidence of Positive Relationships.

Look for messages that demonstrate:
- Evidence of love
- Evidence of care
- Evidence of trust
- Evidence of respect
- Evidence of support
- Evidence of help
- Evidence of appreciate
- Evidence of thank
- Evidence of sorry
- Evidence of good

For each message, provide:
1. A brief assessment of how it shows Positive Relationships
2. Key phrases or words that serve as evidence
3. How this could support the defense case

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on Positive Relationships in your analysis.
