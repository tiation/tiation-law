      "message_text": "Hi Louisa, \n\nI never said what you did was wrong. I agreed with you that what my Aunty said was not a nice thing to do and I wanted to sort it out on my own so that there would be no further conflict. You didn't listen to me and took it upon yourself to bring things up to her about events that occurred 40-50 years ago. Why? It is irrelevant to what TODAYS issue is, we are sorting out todays problems, the ones that are in our face. The message you had sent was different to the one you had shown me in your notes, the one you had shown me I had found much more mature and reasonable and relevant to the issue at hand but this was not the message you had sent. \n\nYou have called me an asshole, despicable, a little pussy and the worst man you've ever met in your life. These are words of abuse that you've said to me Louisa. I'm not here to correct you or anything but if you really see me as that, then you have forgotten all of the good and positive things I have brought to you and Joshua throughout our relationship. \n\nI never wanted this Lulu. I never wanted you and I to be in this situation EVER. I wanted us to be a cooperative family unit, to be on equal grounds between us and have happiness in our lives. I want people in my life and you want people in your life. I have never told you to pick sides as this is something I don't believe in (personally I think it's a childish act). I'm not someone who does this, I'm someone who wants EVERYONE to work together and to be happy with each other and to get along, this is something you have told me that you want too. \n\nPeople in their lives make mistakes whether it's the past or the present. I choose people in my life who can forgive themselves and move towards a positive and better right way of life. You stated to me that you don't support my grandparents for supporting my uncle, okay that's fine you can think that way that's YOUR choice and MY grandparents choice is theirs but that doesn't mean we have now a non-violent person (YOU) and violent people (GRANDPARENTS). It's just someone's beliefs it does not define someone as a person, remember when you stated at your philosophy club when you said that you would let a baby get killed by someone even though you had the power to stop it with a gun? That was YOUR belief right and everyone else stated they would kill that person ti save the baby. YOUR belief was completely the opposite to THEIR belief. Now did they judge you and think that you are completely wrong and decided that you need to be blocked due to your belief? No they didn't. Because it is YOUR belief Louisa. Anyway I know what I've said will not be heard or understood by you. \n\nI love you Louisa and I always will. I don't want to go to court but if you're not going to let me see the kids and cooperate and work with me as I have asked you to, then that's what has to happen and I'm sorry. \n\nLove Adam",
