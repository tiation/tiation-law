Sentiment: positive (score: 0.74)
Text: It is not low at all it is reality. Paying for Joshua's health insurance should not be my sole responsibility, it should be Michael's but he won't do it and you won't talk to him about it. 

The way I see it, you and Michael actually need to sort things out like this for Joshua instead of you both always trying to one up each other in buying Joshua things that he wants and you can't deny that, I have seen both you and Michael behave in this way. 

Yeah you are the sole parent Louisa because you have chosen that. I have asked you to have Lily 50/50 but you have refused that, you said "no".
