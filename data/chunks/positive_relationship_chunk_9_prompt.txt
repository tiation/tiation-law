Text: Louisa I really don't know what to say to you anymore. This isn't the first time that you have pulled a stunt like this as you have previously told me before you have done this with previous partners. 

I do not want to be with you anymore, as of now our relationship is over as your actions towards me are toxic. I would like to have Lily every second week please as we are equally both her parents. If you are not wanting to do that then that is your choice we will then be going to family court.
