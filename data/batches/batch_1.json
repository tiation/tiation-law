You knew that message would have reactions that weren't going to be in your favour. I'm sorry that this happened and even when it did happen I still stayed with you Louisa. \n\nI have not lied about you to my family. I don't know where you are getting this from but it is not true. \n\nI did not assault you Louisa. We were both in a tight space and I wanted to get through it and you to stood in the way. I apologise that I bumped you into you and wasn't my intention as I thought you were going to move out the way. \n\nI didn't want to leave at all. You had put me in a situation where I have zero choice for both the kids, you state to me that I'm a parent yet you take the choices that parents have for kids away from me. I did not feel like part of the family unit at all Lou. You told me that getting a free car to help me, to help us, to help the family work together would be disrespectful. It doesn't matter where I was getting the car or who I was getting it from. I was looking at the bigger picture so that our family could be more functional especially between you and I but you did not see that. \n\nI don't know what to do with us...I love you Louisa and I always will and I love the kids and I do want to see them BOTH.

But obviously he would've had some bad things happened to him, it just sounds like it didn't stick with him. Like I'm not sure how old he was when he got the ball thrown at him by his younger sibling but I can imagine that before that ball was thrown they would've been best friends and played and was happy and then all of a sudden he got physically hurt by his brother and that's why I think that's why he has said that's the worst thing that happened to him, trust me when you have someone physically hurt you after you've had all this fun it sticks with you.
