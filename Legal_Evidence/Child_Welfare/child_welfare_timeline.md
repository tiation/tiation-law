Then he must've had a really good supporting family when he was growing up, it sounds like the first like 16 years of his life seemed really good. But obviously he would've had some bad things happened to him, it just sounds like it didn't stick with him. Like I'm not sure how old he was when he got the ball thrown at him by his younger sibling but I can imagine that before that ball was thrown they would've been best friends and played and was happy and then all of a sudden he got physically hurt by his brother and that's why I think that's why he has said that's the worst thing that happened to him, trust me when you have someone physically hurt you after you've had all this fun it sticks with you.

Who says though Lou? I hate explaining myself to people who are not good, it's a waste of my time, my effort and my life. I'm going to ignore people who are abusive and condone abuse. My silence to them is all they deserve, why should I give them more? Why do I need to make them feel satisfied with my reasons? They don't. No one has done it to you, no one has done it to me. Did Ali send you messages and explain himself to you? Did he give you the time to explain himself for his actions?

I'm doing okay thank you and yes I'm all well and you don't have to worry about me finding shelter or food, I'm doing my best. I want to be sure that you and the kids are okay and have enough for everything that you guys need. 

These questions that you have asked me I just right now have no answers to them. The career question though is still the same as we talked about, still studying nursing next year and doing acting/directing in between

This house that I planned to go to is my grandparents house which I told you I was going to. 

Again I did not choose any sides because choosing sides is a ridiculous concept to begin with, you had stated to my Aunty about events that occurred 40-50 years ago about my grandparents, this was your choice to send that message not me, not Lily and not Joshua it was yours. You knew that message would have reactions that weren't going to be in your favour. I'm sorry that this happened and even when it did happen I still stayed with you Louisa. 

I have not lied about you to my family. I don't know where you are getting this from but it is not true. 

I did not assault you Louisa. We were both in a tight space and I wanted to get through it and you to stood in the way. I apologise that I bumped you into you and wasn't my intention as I thought you were going to move out the way. 

I didn't want to leave at all. You had put me in a situation where I have zero choice for both the kids, you state to me that I'm a parent yet you take the choices that parents have for kids away from me. I did not feel like part of the family unit at all Lou. You told me that getting a free car to help me, to help us, to help the family work together would be disrespectful. It doesn't matter where I was getting the car or who I was getting it from. I was looking at the bigger picture so that our family could be more functional especially between you and I but you did not see that. 

I don't know what to do with us...I love you Louisa and I always will and I love the kids and I do want to see them BOTH.

Louisa. You and I just need to stop talking at this moment. We are both fighting and it is not healthy for either of us or the kids. So please let's take a break for the day/night and maybe we can discuss this better as matured adults tomorrow when we are not letting our emotions out.

Hi Louisa, 

I never said what you did was wrong. I agreed with you that what my Aunty said was not a nice thing to do and I wanted to sort it out on my own so that there would be no further conflict. You didn't listen to me and took it upon yourself to bring things up to her about events that occurred 40-50 years ago. Why? It is irrelevant to what TODAYS issue is, we are sorting out todays problems, the ones that are in our face. The message you had sent was different to the one you had shown me in your notes, the one you had shown me I had found much more mature and reasonable and relevant to the issue at hand but this was not the message you had sent. 

You have called me an asshole, despicable, a little pussy and the worst man you've ever met in your life. These are words of abuse that you've said to me Louisa. I'm not here to correct you or anything but if you really see me as that, then you have forgotten all of the good and positive things I have brought to you and Joshua throughout our relationship. 

I never wanted this Lulu. I never wanted you and I to be in this situation EVER. I wanted us to be a cooperative family unit, to be on equal grounds between us and have happiness in our lives. I want people in my life and you want people in your life. I have never told you to pick sides as this is something I don't believe in (personally I think it's a childish act). I'm not someone who does this, I'm someone who wants EVERYONE to work together and to be happy with each other and to get along, this is something you have told me that you want too. 

People in their lives make mistakes whether it's the past or the present. I choose people in my life who can forgive themselves and move towards a positive and better right way of life. You stated to me that you don't support my grandparents for supporting my uncle, okay that's fine you can think that way that's YOUR choice and MY grandparents choice is theirs but that doesn't mean we have now a non-violent person (YOU) and violent people (GRANDPARENTS). It's just someone's beliefs it does not define someone as a person, remember when you stated at your philosophy club when you said that you would let a baby get killed by someone even though you had the power to stop it with a gun? That was YOUR belief right and everyone else stated they would kill that person ti save the baby. YOUR belief was completely the opposite to THEIR belief. Now did they judge you and think that you are completely wrong and decided that you need to be blocked due to your belief? No they didn't. Because it is YOUR belief Louisa. Anyway I know what I've said will not be heard or understood by you. 

I love you Louisa and I always will. I don't want to go to court but if you're not going to let me see the kids and cooperate and work with me as I have asked you to, then that's what has to happen and I'm sorry. 

Love Adam

Do you remember when we went and saw Mike that night. That night I could've said so many things to Mike about all the bad things he had done but I didn't Louisa and I'll tell you why, it's because you wanted to cooperate with Mike and you wanted Joshua to see Mike. I knew this is what you wanted and I put everything aside to make sure that this would happen, I put you and Joshua before anything else because I knew you wanted to cooperate with Mike and I knew Joshua wanted to see Mike and be happy. I wanted the things that the two of you wanted without question or hostility. I wanted to make sure that you and Joshua achieved what you both wanted.

Have I told you yet today that I love you?

I feel so proud of you for fitting in your work and studies. But I'll also feel proud of you if you don't or if you choose a different path. When I saw you today doing your play with your baby, after just doing an exam, I was so impressed.

I felt so proud when you used our agreed upon discipline plan yesterday with Joshua. 

You are my hero of the day.

It is not low at all it is reality. Paying for Joshua's health insurance should not be my sole responsibility, it should be Michael's but he won't do it and you won't talk to him about it. 

The way I see it, you and Michael actually need to sort things out like this for Joshua instead of you both always trying to one up each other in buying Joshua things that he wants and you can't deny that, I have seen both you and Michael behave in this way. 

Yeah you are the sole parent Louisa because you have chosen that. I have asked you to have Lily 50/50 but you have refused that, you said "no".

Okay Michael gives you $900 or something every month and you've stated the doesn't always pay it. I pay half your rent and your wifi for your house $380 x 2 = $760 and $90. Which equals up to $850 a month and I work casually and I'm a full time student, I don't earn over a 100k a year but I still pay $850 a month to for you and the kids to continue living in Mosman Park and having internet and I don't complain one bit about that. 

You may say it's low all you want but you forget my situation and the things I already pay for you. It is really not my responsibility to pay for yours and Joshua's health insurance, Joshua's health insurance should be 100% discussed with you and Michael.

So typical, you always put Joshua's bratty needs before anything else, just like you did when Lily was in the bath struggling for her life and all you did was make sure Joshua was "happy" even though he is a spoiled brat who deserves nothing.

You know Lily isn't a 35 year old person or a 7 year old kid that can make choices that are safe or not, she is a baby it's not her fault at all. It's yours and Joshua's fault and the both of you are hiding the truth about what happened to Lily
