## Interpreting Sentiment Analysis Results

The sentiment analysis used the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) algorithm, which is specifically tuned for social media and conversational text:

- **Compound Score:** Range from -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive)
  - Scores ≥ 0.05 are classified as positive
  - Scores ≤ -0.05 are classified as negative
  - Scores between -0.05 and 0.05 are classified as neutral

- **Keyword Detection:** Messages were analyzed for specific keywords related to:
  - Positive relationships (e.g., love, care, trust, respect)
  - Parental care (e.g., children, family, protect, school)
  - Child welfare (e.g., safety, wellbeing, health, support)

### Limitations
- Automated sentiment analysis may miss context or nuance
- Some messages may be misclassified based on complex language
- Analysis does not account for non-textual communication (tone, emojis)
