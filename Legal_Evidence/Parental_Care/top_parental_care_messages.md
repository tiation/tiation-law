Loved "Dear Adam

Have I told you yet today that I love you?

I feel so proud of you for fitting in your work and studies. But I'll also feel proud of you if you don't or if you choose a different path. When I saw you today doing your play with your baby, after just doing an exam, I was so impressed.

I felt so proud when you used our agreed upon discipline plan yesterday with Joshua. 

You are my hero of the day.

Louisa"

This house that I planned to go to is my grandparents house which I told you I was going to. 

Again I did not choose any sides because choosing sides is a ridiculous concept to begin with, you had stated to my Aunty about events that occurred 40-50 years ago about my grandparents, this was your choice to send that message not me, not Lily and not Joshua it was yours. You knew that message would have reactions that weren't going to be in your favour. I'm sorry that this happened and even when it did happen I still stayed with you Louisa. 

I have not lied about you to my family. I don't know where you are getting this from but it is not true. 

I did not assault you Louisa. We were both in a tight space and I wanted to get through it and you to stood in the way. I apologise that I bumped you into you and wasn't my intention as I thought you were going to move out the way. 

I didn't want to leave at all. You had put me in a situation where I have zero choice for both the kids, you state to me that I'm a parent yet you take the choices that parents have for kids away from me. I did not feel like part of the family unit at all Lou. You told me that getting a free car to help me, to help us, to help the family work together would be disrespectful. It doesn't matter where I was getting the car or who I was getting it from. I was looking at the bigger picture so that our family could be more functional especially between you and I but you did not see that. 

I don't know what to do with us...I love you Louisa and I always will and I love the kids and I do want to see them BOTH.

Louisa I haven't made you feel like any of this. It is not a domestic violence relationship, I did not threaten Lily I was playing around with her like every other parent does with their kids (play wrestling) but you don't see it that way. I did not make you lose your job I am not making you lose your friends, I've spent most of my day helping you get things ready and get your shopping for your party, a domestic violence perpetrator wouldn't have done that and would have made you do everything yourself and then would tell you to not go to the party etc.

Then he must've had a really good supporting family when he was growing up, it sounds like the first like 16 years of his life seemed really good. But obviously he would've had some bad things happened to him, it just sounds like it didn't stick with him. Like I'm not sure how old he was when he got the ball thrown at him by his younger sibling but I can imagine that before that ball was thrown they would've been best friends and played and was happy and then all of a sudden he got physically hurt by his brother and that's why I think that's why he has said that's the worst thing that happened to him, trust me when you have someone physically hurt you after you've had all this fun it sticks with you.

Hi Lou, 

I'm doing okay thank you and yes I'm all well and you don't have to worry about me finding shelter or food, I'm doing my best. I want to be sure that you and the kids are okay and have enough for everything that you guys need. 

These questions that you have asked me I just right now have no answers to them. The career question though is still the same as we talked about, still studying nursing next year and doing acting/directing in between

Yeah but I'm not responding to messages like this:

"A woman's mother dies, she attends the funeral and at the reception she meets a really kind intelligent interesting man. They chat & enjoy each other's company, but don't end up exchanging numbers. 

A few weeks later the woman murders her sister.

Why does she do it?"
