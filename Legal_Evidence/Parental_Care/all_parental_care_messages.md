Loved "Dear Adam

Have I told you yet today that I love you?

I feel so proud of you for fitting in your work and studies. But I'll also feel proud of you if you don't or if you choose a different path. When I saw you today doing your play with your baby, after just doing an exam, I was so impressed.

I felt so proud when you used our agreed upon discipline plan yesterday with Joshua. 

You are my hero of the day.

Louisa"

This house that I planned to go to is my grandparents house which I told you I was going to. 

Again I did not choose any sides because choosing sides is a ridiculous concept to begin with, you had stated to my Aunty about events that occurred 40-50 years ago about my grandparents, this was your choice to send that message not me, not Lily and not Joshua it was yours. You knew that message would have reactions that weren't going to be in your favour. I'm sorry that this happened and even when it did happen I still stayed with you Louisa. 

I have not lied about you to my family. I don't know where you are getting this from but it is not true. 

I did not assault you Louisa. We were both in a tight space and I wanted to get through it and you to stood in the way. I apologise that I bumped you into you and wasn't my intention as I thought you were going to move out the way. 

I didn't want to leave at all. You had put me in a situation where I have zero choice for both the kids, you state to me that I'm a parent yet you take the choices that parents have for kids away from me. I did not feel like part of the family unit at all Lou. You told me that getting a free car to help me, to help us, to help the family work together would be disrespectful. It doesn't matter where I was getting the car or who I was getting it from. I was looking at the bigger picture so that our family could be more functional especially between you and I but you did not see that. 

I don't know what to do with us...I love you Louisa and I always will and I love the kids and I do want to see them BOTH.

Louisa I haven't made you feel like any of this. It is not a domestic violence relationship, I did not threaten Lily I was playing around with her like every other parent does with their kids (play wrestling) but you don't see it that way. I did not make you lose your job I am not making you lose your friends, I've spent most of my day helping you get things ready and get your shopping for your party, a domestic violence perpetrator wouldn't have done that and would have made you do everything yourself and then would tell you to not go to the party etc.

Then he must've had a really good supporting family when he was growing up, it sounds like the first like 16 years of his life seemed really good. But obviously he would've had some bad things happened to him, it just sounds like it didn't stick with him. Like I'm not sure how old he was when he got the ball thrown at him by his younger sibling but I can imagine that before that ball was thrown they would've been best friends and played and was happy and then all of a sudden he got physically hurt by his brother and that's why I think that's why he has said that's the worst thing that happened to him, trust me when you have someone physically hurt you after you've had all this fun it sticks with you.

Hi Lou, 

I'm doing okay thank you and yes I'm all well and you don't have to worry about me finding shelter or food, I'm doing my best. I want to be sure that you and the kids are okay and have enough for everything that you guys need. 

These questions that you have asked me I just right now have no answers to them. The career question though is still the same as we talked about, still studying nursing next year and doing acting/directing in between

Yeah but I'm not responding to messages like this:

"A woman's mother dies, she attends the funeral and at the reception she meets a really kind intelligent interesting man. They chat & enjoy each other's company, but don't end up exchanging numbers. 

A few weeks later the woman murders her sister.

Why does she do it?"

Joshua is talking to also his Aunty on the phone as well as Michael 
Michael and his Aunty were talking about school 
It's the Aunty from next door 
Joshua then said I was an army doctor from a movie I was in 
Joshua asked if they had a good time during the holidays 
Joshua's Aunty was on the phone with Michael for a total of 2 minutes and then she left 
Michael then said that when Joshua sees him next he will meet his biological family 
Joshua then kept on saying things what he wanted for his birthday 
Joshua said to Michael he is going to have an early birthday 
Michael asked Joshua what he's doing, Joshua said he is in his playroom, Michael then asked who he is with, Joshua responded "no one" which is true because Joshua was in his playroom with the door closed 
After this, they kept talking about army stuff 
From there Michaels parents had arrived and Joshua was speaking with them 
Michaels parents weren't on the phone for even a minute
From there Michael then stated he needed to go too 
The phone call ended

Do you know what's sad Louisa? That every time I take Lily to the park now, she just sits there in her pram watching all the other kids have fun and make friends, no other kid wants to come up and talk or say hi to Lily. Yes you are the one who has made this happen, yes you and Joshua are the reason why Lily is the way she is. But the two of you don't give a fuck, the two of can go on and live normal lives but Lily doesn't.

It is not low at all it is reality. Paying for Joshua's health insurance should not be my sole responsibility, it should be Michael's but he won't do it and you won't talk to him about it. 

The way I see it, you and Michael actually need to sort things out like this for Joshua instead of you both always trying to one up each other in buying Joshua things that he wants and you can't deny that, I have seen both you and Michael behave in this way. 

Yeah you are the sole parent Louisa because you have chosen that. I have asked you to have Lily 50/50 but you have refused that, you said "no".

Louisa I really don't know what to say to you anymore. This isn't the first time that you have pulled a stunt like this as you have previously told me before you have done this with previous partners. 

I do not want to be with you anymore, as of now our relationship is over as your actions towards me are toxic. I would like to have Lily every second week please as we are equally both her parents. If you are not wanting to do that then that is your choice we will then be going to family court.

Well I don't know Lou, I don't know who to allow in my life. At the moment I'm so confused on who I want in my life including family and friends because I don't know now. I hate having friction or tension with people, it makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't want people in my life that think violence is "okay" to commit on other people. I don't have an inner circle, I don't have close friends anymore.

Okay Michael gives you $900 or something every month and you've stated the doesn't always pay it. I pay half your rent and your wifi for your house $380 x 2 = $760 and $90. Which equals up to $850 a month and I work casually and I'm a full time student, I don't earn over a 100k a year but I still pay $850 a month to for you and the kids to continue living in Mosman Park and having internet and I don't complain one bit about that. 

You may say it's low all you want but you forget my situation and the things I already pay for you. It is really not my responsibility to pay for yours and Joshua's health insurance, Joshua's health insurance should be 100% discussed with you and Michael.

It is spelt 'pedophile'. You state that your dad is a pedophile. Your dad visits with your mum. Joshua has behavioural issues and as soon as he fixes that he can visit, if you must know I arrange with Michael (Joshua's actual dad) to visit on Saturday but Joshua had refused get ready or do anything to visit Lily proving my point that Joshua has issues, so Joshua did not visit due to his attitude and behaviour.

I no longer want to continue this conversation with you because all it's doing is going back and forth and I'm over it. You can say whatever you want Louisa, I'm not here to change your mind or pull you up on your behaviour that's not my responsibility.

Hi Louisa, 

I never said what you did was wrong. I agreed with you that what my Aunty said was not a nice thing to do and I wanted to sort it out on my own so that there would be no further conflict. You didn't listen to me and took it upon yourself to bring things up to her about events that occurred 40-50 years ago. Why? It is irrelevant to what TODAYS issue is, we are sorting out todays problems, the ones that are in our face. The message you had sent was different to the one you had shown me in your notes, the one you had shown me I had found much more mature and reasonable and relevant to the issue at hand but this was not the message you had sent. 

You have called me an asshole, despicable, a little pussy and the worst man you've ever met in your life. These are words of abuse that you've said to me Louisa. I'm not here to correct you or anything but if you really see me as that, then you have forgotten all of the good and positive things I have brought to you and Joshua throughout our relationship. 

I never wanted this Lulu. I never wanted you and I to be in this situation EVER. I wanted us to be a cooperative family unit, to be on equal grounds between us and have happiness in our lives. I want people in my life and you want people in your life. I have never told you to pick sides as this is something I don't believe in (personally I think it's a childish act). I'm not someone who does this, I'm someone who wants EVERYONE to work together and to be happy with each other and to get along, this is something you have told me that you want too. 

People in their lives make mistakes whether it's the past or the present. I choose people in my life who can forgive themselves and move towards a positive and better right way of life. You stated to me that you don't support my grandparents for supporting my uncle, okay that's fine you can think that way that's YOUR choice and MY grandparents choice is theirs but that doesn't mean we have now a non-violent person (YOU) and violent people (GRANDPARENTS). It's just someone's beliefs it does not define someone as a person, remember when you stated at your philosophy club when you said that you would let a baby get killed by someone even though you had the power to stop it with a gun? That was YOUR belief right and everyone else stated they would kill that person ti save the baby. YOUR belief was completely the opposite to THEIR belief. Now did they judge you and think that you are completely wrong and decided that you need to be blocked due to your belief? No they didn't. Because it is YOUR belief Louisa. Anyway I know what I've said will not be heard or understood by you. 

I love you Louisa and I always will. I don't want to go to court but if you're not going to let me see the kids and cooperate and work with me as I have asked you to, then that's what has to happen and I'm sorry. 

Love Adam

Joshua and Michael spoke about the sloth
Then Joshua brought up that he has the coronavirus 
Joshua then stated to Michael that he doesn't get enough presents from Michael, the reason why Joshua stated this is because he can't see him this week so he needs 2 presents
Joshua then told Michael to tell his cousins that he can't see him
Michael then asked Joshua what his symptoms were and Joshua said he had a sore throat and a cough
The conversation then was just about the coronavirus and how the vaccine doesn't work
Michael then asked if Adam was there and Joshua said that I am there and that I have coronavirus too 
Michael then brought up if Joshua asked about a sleepover in which Joshua didn't say anything about the sleepover and Michael then apologised to Joshua for bringing it up
From there, the conversation was about how Joshua can't go anywhere because of the coronavirus 
There was a long pause 
Joshua then talked about building forts together 
Michael then brought up to Joshua that they should get a drone and go fishing together with the drone and will get a special drone for fishing 
Joshua then said he can bring it back to his family's house but Michael said no as the drone would be "his house" toy only 
Michael then brought up that he can fix anything as Joshua said to him that his old drone is busted 
Michael then stated that he is going to go now and will talk to him on Thursday
