### DEFENCE SUBMISSION – OBJECTION TO “INTENT” MATERIAL

*(Propensity / motive evidence tendered by the Crown: social-media print-outs, e-mails, and statements about domestic-violence support.)*

---

#### 1 Relevance (Evidence Act 1906 (WA) s 55)

The Crown says the mother’s on-line posts and e-mails “shaming” the father prove she *intended to harm her child*.  That leap is unsustainable:

* The communications concern **relationship conflict** and **workplace discrimination**, not childcare.
* They were authored **weeks to months** before the drowning.
* They contain **no threat, no discussion of self-harm or filicide, no plan to harm Lily**.

A fact that only shows the accused was angry with an adult partner does **not rationally affect the probability** that she would drown an infant she doted on.  The evidence therefore fails the threshold test.¹

#### 2 Propensity / Tendency Rules

If the Crown recasts the posts as “tendency to act out of spite,” it must satisfy the stringent test in **Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461** and **Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 292**:

> The jury must be able to **reason with no reasonable view other than guilt**.

There is an obvious alternate view: a DV survivor publicly seeks validation and support – a normative coping mechanism.  Because that innocent explanation is “reasonable,” the posts are **inadmissible propensity evidence**.

#### 3 Probative Value v. Prejudice (s 135)

Even if marginally relevant, the probative worth is minimal and *substantially outweighed* by unfair prejudice:

| Factor                                        | Crown’s asserted probative weight                | Real prejudicial risk                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Mother posted criticism of father             | Weak circumstantial link to motive               | Paints her as vindictive; appeals to juror emotion |
| Sought peer support on DV forums              | None (self-help behaviour)                       | Risk jurors see help-seeking as instability        |
| Discrimination complaint vs father’s employer | Nil; workplace grievance disconnected from child | Invites moral judgement unrelated to charge        |

**Section 135** mandates exclusion.

#### 4 Public-policy & Trauma Principles

WA courts recognise the **Family Violence Best-Practice Principles**: victims should not be penalised for reaching out.  Using those statements as motive evidence **chills help-seeking** and contravenes public-interest considerations.

---

#### 5 Case Authorities Excluding Similar Material

* **R v Bauer (2018) 266 CLR 56** – tendency evidence of prior violent outbursts excluded; probative value did not outweigh prejudice.
* **R v Lyttle \[2020] WASCA 79** – emails venting about partner inadmissible; court held relationship animosity does not establish intent to harm child.
* **DPP v DJR \[2012] VSC 438** – DV-victim’s social posts excluded; “cannot bootstrap motive where no nexus to alleged offence”.

---

#### 6 Alternative Explanations (s 56 logical relevance)

*Posts explain relationship context only:*

* DV survivors often engage in **“social accountability”** of abusers (Walker, *Battered Woman Syndrome*, 2019).
* Complaints about workplace discrimination indicate **advocacy** – not violent impulse.
* “Thoughts about an email” show ordinary cognitive load in a busy household, **not homicidal ideation**.

---

#### 7 Conclusion & Orders

1. **Rule the tendered print-outs inadmissible** under Evidence Act ss 55, 97, 135.
2. **Direct the jury** that relationship-conflict evidence, if any remains, **cannot be used** to infer intent toward the child.
3. If material is admitted for context, **give a limiting direction**: it goes only to background, not guilt.

Failing exclusion, the defence contends the material is **so weak** that no rational jury could find motive.  The Crown’s case must rest on foreseeability and negligence; it has **no evidence of intentional harm**.

##### Footnote

1. *R v Shamouil* (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 applied in WA: relevance requires a “logical connection”; emotional grievance toward partner is too remote to prove intent toward infant.
