# Defense Strategy: Tia L. Jeffery Case

## The Charge
Ms. Tia L. Jeffery is charged under **Section 101(1)** of the *Children and Community Services Act 2004 (WA)* â€“ "Failure to Protect a Child from Harm".

## Elements of the Offense
For a conviction, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt ALL four elements:

1. **Care of the child** - The accused had care of Lily
2. **Harm occurred** - Lily suffered serious harm (drowning)
3. **Harm was reasonably foreseeable** - A reasonable parent would have foreseen the risk
4. **Reasonable steps were not taken** - The accused failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the harm

## Defense Position on Each Element

### 1. Care of the Child
- **Conceded:** Ms. Jeffery was Lily's mother and primary caregiver.

### 2. Harm Occurred
- **Conceded:** Lily suffered serious harm resulting in persistent vegetative state.

### 3. Harm was NOT Reasonably Foreseeable
- **Timeline Evidence:** The time frame was less than 1 minute, maximum 2 minutes.
- **Physical Layout:** Floor plan shows the bathroom was not visible from the toilet.
- **Behavioral History:** Lily had never previously accessed the bathroom unsupervised.
- **Supervision:** Ms. Jeffery maintained what she believed was a full sight-line to Joshua's room where Lily was playing.
- **Routine Activity:** The bath filling was part of normal congestion-clearing routine.
- **Unexpected Access:** A previously unidentified bathroom step may have provided Lily access to the bath that she never had before.
- **Legal Precedent:** WA cases (TPL 2013, Master K 2021) found brief lapses in supervision do not satisfy foreseeability when the hazard is in a separate room.

### 4. Reasonable Steps WERE Taken
- **Active Supervision:** Ms. Jeffery was physically present and supervising both children.
- **Safety Planning:** Baby gates had been delivered by grandparents Diana and Terry, and installation was being arranged with Adam.
- **Prompt Response:** Ms. Jeffery immediately searched for Lily when she noticed her absence.
- **Parenting History:** Ms. Jeffery was known as a "helicopter parent" with no prior incidents.
- **Emergency Response:** Ms. Jeffery:
  - Immediately retrieved Lily from the bath
  - Applied resuscitation techniques based on knowledge available to her
  - Called emergency services promptly
  - Followed dispatcher instructions
  - Continued CPR until paramedics arrived
  - Ensured Joshua's safety with a trusted neighbor
  - Later took a CPR course to improve her skills

## Key Defense Arguments

### 1. Time Frame
- The unsupervised period was less than 1 minute, maximum 2 minutes
- This is consistent with routine activity theory and not a gross departure from reasonable care

### 2. Scene Evidence Explained
- **Empty Bath:** Ms. Jeffery pulled the plug instinctively when retrieving Lily
- **Dry Hair:** Toweling and air flow dried Lily's fine infant hair in the 12 minutes before paramedics arrived
- **No Wet Clothing:** Lily was nude ("nudy rudy") as part of the normal bath routine

### 3. Initial Reporting Bias
- **False Claim:** Initial report alleged "90-minute neglect" while "mother playing with Joshua"
- **Source Bias:** Reported by Tammy Perry, who allegedly "hated Tia"
- **Motivation:** Tammy claimed Ms. Jeffery "hated Adam" because Ms. Jeffery had requested help regarding Adam's behavior
- **Impact:** This false claim created a distorted lens through which the case was viewed despite being conclusively disproven

### 4. Family Dynamics Context
- **Multiple Witnesses:** Reports of concerning behavior by Adam (Lily's father) toward Joshua:
  - Polly Montey's mother reported Joshua said Adam was hurting him and hitting his head
  - Jo Zac's mother reported similar concerns
  - Diana and Terry (grandparents) observed Adam bullying Joshua
  - Ms. Jeffery witnessed similar incidents
- **Help-Seeking:** Ms. Jeffery was actively seeking help and support before the incident:
  - Reading books about addressing difficult relationships
  - Taking photos of "Hold Me Tight" book on July 24, 2022 (day before incident)
  - Reaching out to community members and an Aboriginal leader regarding Adam's behavior
- **Specific Incident:** Adam allegedly became angry after drinking, called Ms. Jeffery names, chased her upstairs while holding Lily, and hit her bedroom door, striking her arm
- **Relationship After Cheating Discovery:**
  - Following Tia discovering Adam's cheating, they remained friends and were intimate
  - Tia and Adam were speaking, although at times arguing
  - Tia clearly articulated her intention when sharing Adam's violent/abusive/bad behavior was to help him
  - Tia stated: "Is the parent who take scissors away from a running child a bad parent? The child may cry. And I am sorry youre hurt but it is the right thing to do"
  - Tia and Adam remained close until she was unable to send him money
  - Adam told Tia to see Lily, but when she did, he would insist they have sex
  - Tia was threatened with violence and murder by Adam's mother
  - Adam said these threats were acceptable because Lily died while in Tia's care
  - Adam threatened to take Tia to court if she tried to get custody of Lily and said he would claim she was unsafe
  - Tia has videos of incidents when Adam left her alone with Lily after coercing her into sex and then going out
- **Legal Relevance:** These dynamics provide critical context for understanding Ms. Jeffery's safety planning efforts and the potential bias in the initial reporting

### 5. Case Precedents
- Similar cases in WA with brief supervision lapses have been deemed accidents, not criminal negligence
- The current prosecution contradicts established precedent

### 6. Post-Incident Behavior
- Ms. Jeffery's desperate attempts to revive Lily
- The "90 minutes of hell" during which Ms. Jeffery experienced "absolute excruciating pain" while "screaming for Lily to come back"
- Her continuous advocacy for treatment (HBOT requests)
- Taking a CPR course immediately after the incident
- All demonstrate a loving, committed parent, not one who failed to protect

## Multi-Pronged Defense Strategy

### 1. Challenge the Legal Basis
- File motion to dismiss based on failure to satisfy the "reasonably foreseeable" and "reasonable steps" elements
- Present precedent cases showing similar brief lapses ruled as accidents

### 2. Present the Physical Evidence
- Floor plan demonstrating bathroom not visible from toilet
- Previously unidentified bathroom step that may have provided unexpected access
- Scientific explanation for empty bath and dry hair observations

### 3. Challenge the Initial Reporting
- Document Tammy Perry's bias and motivation
- Present timeline evidence that conclusively disproves the "90-minute neglect" claim
- Expert testimony on how initial misinformation biases investigations and proceedings

### 4. Provide Family Context
- Present evidence of Ms. Jeffery's help-seeking behavior
- Document witness accounts of Adam's concerning behavior
- Introduce the "Hold Me Tight" book photos from July 24, 2022

### 5. Demonstrate Ms. Jeffery's Character
- Prior "helicopter parent" history
- Immediate and desperate resuscitation efforts
- Ensuring Joshua's safety during the emergency
- Post-incident advocacy and proactive safety education (CPR course)

## Conclusion
The evidence clearly shows that this was a tragic accident, not a criminal failure to protect. Ms. Jeffery took reasonable steps to protect her child, responded appropriately in an emergency, and has demonstrated her commitment to Lily's care both before and after the incident. The prosecution cannot meet the high burden of proof required for a conviction under Section 101(1) of the Children and Community Services Act 2004 (WA).

Furthermore, the case has been prejudiced by demonstrably false initial reporting from a biased source, creating an "anchoring effect" that has persisted despite being disproven by objective evidence. The broader family dynamics provide important context for understanding Ms. Jeffery's safety planning efforts and the potential motivations behind the false reporting.
