### Focused Defence Note – “Empty Bath” Claim

**Crown assertion:** *“Because first-responders found no water in the tub, Lily could not have drowned there.”*

#### 1 Physics and Plumbing Reality

| Parameter                                                    | Typical value (domestic WA tub) | Calculation | Result                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Half-full bath volume                                        | ≈ 90–100 L                      | —           | 100 L                     |
| Standard drain flow (40 mm outlet, gravity, no hair-catcher) | ≈ 30 L min⁻¹ (plumber’s tables) | 100 L ÷ 30  | **≈ 3 min 20 s to empty** |
| Gap between 000 call and paramedic entry                     | **≥ 12 min**                    | —           | Water long gone           |

Even if the mother had not touched the plug, a child thrashing or being lifted commonly **dislodges the pop-up plug**; the tub empties itself in under four minutes—well before help arrives.

#### 2 Immediate-rescue Behaviour Is Predictable

Parents in panic almost invariably

1. **pull the plug** (to stop further risk, gain space), and
2. **wrap the child** (towelling = warmth & airway clearance).

Both actions leave an empty, apparently “dry” scene yet are entirely consistent with a real drowning – coroners note this in dozens of bath-fatality files (e.g. *TPL* WA 2013; *Baby L* QLD 2015).

#### 3 Expert Testimony Outline

* **Plumbing engineer:** drain-rate experiment video; replicate 3-min emptying.
* **Paediatric emergency nurse:** common parental actions; towel-dry hair in <10 min.
* **First paramedic on scene:** confirm bathroom floor was wet/damp on arrival (if recollection allows).

#### 4 Legal Angle

*Circumstantial evidence must be **consistent with innocence** if the Crown is to exclude reasonable doubt* (*Stevenson v R*, HCA 2000).
The empty tub is not inconsistent with a drowning following a three-minute drainage window. Therefore it carries **no probative force against the mother**.

#### 5 Draft Cross-Examination Questions

1. **“Constable, did you test whether the plug was open when you arrived?”**
2. **“Would you agree it is possible the water drained naturally in the 12-minute interval?”**
3. **“You saw a towel on the landing—was it damp?”**
4. **“Is it your experience that caregivers often empty the bath without thinking after pulling a child out?”**

### Conclusion

An empty bath **proves nothing**.  Physics, plumbing evidence and typical panic behaviour fully explain the observation.  The Crown must still establish a **positive, alternative mechanism of harm**, which it has not done.
