## Real-Time Demonstration Script

### PART 1: PHYSICAL DEMONSTRATION (Exactly 60 seconds)

[START TIMER - 00:00]

DEMONSTRATOR: "Watch the timer. I will now demonstrate the exact sequence of events using the measured distances in real time."

[00:00 - 00:30] - TOILET USE DEMONSTRATION
- Demonstrator sits on chair (toilet position)
- Assistant activates child dummy movement system
- Jury observes timer counting first 30 seconds
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Medical evidence establishes minimum physiological time of 30 seconds"

[00:30 - 00:35] - INITIAL MOVEMENT
- Demonstrator stands
- Takes two steps to doorway (1.5m ÷ 1.4m/s = 1.1 seconds)
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Floor plan shows exact 1.5m distance"

[00:35 - 00:40] - CHECKING JOSHUA'S ROOM
- Quick movement to room entrance (1.6m ÷ 1.4m/s = 1.1 seconds)
- Visual scan of room
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Distance verified by laser measure"

[00:40 - 00:45] - HALLWAY MOVEMENT
- Rapid walk to bathroom (5.2m ÷ 1.4m/s = 3.7 seconds)
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Measured distance requires 3.7 seconds at normal walking speed"

[00:45 - 00:50] - BATHROOM ENTRY
- Enter bathroom
- Move to tub (1.8m ÷ 1.4m/s = 1.3 seconds)
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Final distance confirmed by floor plan"

[00:50 - 00:55] - DISCOVERY AND ACTION
- Find dummy in tub position
- Begin removal motion
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Scene photo confirms position"

[00:55 - 01:00] - COMPLETION
- Complete removal motion
- Timer shows one minute
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Total sequence completed within one minute"

[STOP TIMER - 01:00]

### PART 2: CHILD MOVEMENT DEMONSTRATION

[RESET TIMER - 00:00]

DEMONSTRATOR: "Now watch as we demonstrate Lily's movement using our test dummy and exact measurements."

[00:00 - 00:17] - CRAWLING DEMONSTRATION
- Dummy moves at 0.3 m/s (documented infant crawling speed)
- Covers 5.2m distance from room to bathroom
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Scientific measurement of infant crawling speed"

[00:17 - 00:22] - STEP ACCESS
- Dummy reaches bathroom step (12.7cm height)
- Shows climbing motion
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Step height verified in scene photos"

[00:22 - 00:25] - TUB ACCESS
- Demonstrates reduced climbing height (33cm with step)
- Shows access capability
- EVIDENCE POINT: "Physical measurements confirm accessibility"

### PART 3: SIGHT LINE DEMONSTRATION

DEMONSTRATOR: "Now observe why visual contact was impossible from the toilet position."

[PHYSICAL DEMONSTRATION]
1. Stand at toilet position
2. Attempt to view bathroom location
3. Show physical impossibility of maintaining visual contact
4. EVIDENCE POINT: "Floor plan confirms no line of sight"

### PART 4: DISTANCE VERIFICATION

DEMONSTRATOR: "Let's verify every distance with the laser measure."

[MEASURE EACH SEGMENT]
1. Toilet to doorway: 1.5m
2. Doorway to room: 1.6m
3. Room to bathroom: 5.2m
4. Bathroom entrance to tub: 1.8m
TOTAL: 10.1 meters

### PART 5: TIME ANCHOR VERIFICATION

DEMONSTRATOR: "Now let's verify our timeline against known timestamps."

[DISPLAY TIMELINE]
- 7:36:15 AM - Start (established by working backward)
- 7:37:15 AM - Discovery (one minute later)
- 7:40:00 AM - Emergency call (phone records)
- 7:52:00 AM - Ambulance arrival (medical records)
- 8:12:00 AM - Scene photos (metadata)

## Key Evidence Points to Emphasize

1. DISTANCE PROOF
- Total distance: 10.1 meters
- Walking speed: 1.4 m/s
- Maximum possible transit time: 7.2 seconds
- CONCLUSION: "Physically impossible to take longer than 7.2 seconds to move through space"

2. TIMING PROOF
- Minimum toilet use: 30 seconds
- Movement time: 7.2 seconds
- Search and discovery: 5-7 seconds
- CONCLUSION: "Sequence must fit within one minute"

3. PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Sight lines prevent visual contact
- Distances require minimum movement times
- Child movement speed is fixed by physics
- CONCLUSION: "Physical laws constrain possible timeline"

## Closing Statement

DEMONSTRATOR: "As we have physically demonstrated:
1. The total distance of 10.1 meters cannot take more than 7.2 seconds to traverse
2. The minimum physiological time for toilet use is 30 seconds
3. The remaining activities must fit within the final 22.8 seconds
4. Therefore, the entire sequence MUST have occurred within one minute, as physical laws and human physiology make a longer timeline impossible."

## Technical Notes
