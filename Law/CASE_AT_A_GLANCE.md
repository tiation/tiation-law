# Tia L. Jeffery Case: At a Glance

## Case Identifier
- **Defendant:** Tia L. Jeffery
- **Charge:** Failure to Protect a Child from Harm (s.101(1) Children and Community Services Act 2004 WA)
- **Incident Date:** July 25, 2022
- **Court:** District Court of Western Australia
- **Status:** Pending (May 2025)

## The Incident
- 11-month-old Lily found unresponsive in bath
- Unsupervised period: less than 1 minute, maximum 2 minutes
- Previously unidentified bathroom step may have provided unexpected access
- Ms. Jeffery immediately began resuscitation efforts
- After 66 minutes of hospital resuscitation ("90 minutes of hell"), Lily survived but with brain-stem-only function
- Lily currently in persistent vegetative state

## Defense Summary
1. Harm was **not reasonably foreseeable**
2. Ms. Jeffery **took reasonable steps** to protect Lily
3. Brief lapse was **not a gross departure** from reasonable care
4. The bathroom step had not been identified as a hazard as Ms. Jeffery was always with Lily
5. Similar cases have been ruled **accidents, not criminal acts**
6. Initial reporting was **biased and factually incorrect**
7. Family dynamics created a **distorted lens** through which the incident was viewed

## Key Facts
- **Floor Plan:** Bathroom not visible from toilet
- **Bathroom Step:** Previously unidentified feature that may have given Lily unexpected access
- **History:** Lily had never accessed bathroom unsupervised before
- **Safety Measures:** Baby gates delivered, installation planned
- **Family Focus:** Photos of "Hold Me Tight" relationship book taken day before (July 24) show commitment to family well-being
- **Parenting:** Ms. Jeffery known as attentive "helicopter parent"
- **Response:** Immediate search, resuscitation, 000 call, and ensuring Joshua's safety with trusted neighbor

## Timeline Highlights
- **July 24, 2022:** Ms. Jeffery takes photos of "Hold Me Tight" book to improve relationship with Adam
- **Before July 25:** Family had banned Ms. Jeffery and her children from Christmas, showing pre-existing scapegoating
- **July 25, 2022 (7:37 AM):** Lily found unresponsive in bath after less than 1-2 minutes
- **July 25, 2022 (7:40 AM):** Emergency call placed
- **July 25, 2022 (8:00-9:06 AM):** "90 minutes of hell" - hospital resuscitation efforts
- **October 2022:** CPFS concludes "No protective concern, matter closed"

## Evidence Clarifications
- **Empty Bath:** Ms. Jeffery pulled plug when retrieving Lily
- **Dry Hair:** Normal evaporation during 12-min paramedic delay
- **No Wet Clothes:** Lily was nude ("nudy rudy") for bath time
- **Bathroom Step:** Previously unidentified hazard that may have provided unexpected access

## Initial Reporting Issues
- **False Claim:** Initial report alleged "90-minute neglect" while "mother playing with Joshua"
- **Source Bias:** Reported by Tammy Perry, who allegedly "hated Tia"
- **Anchoring Effect:** This false claim created persistent bias despite being disproven
- **Objective Evidence:** 000 call records, paramedic timeline confirm the actual 1-2 minute timeframe

## Family Dynamics Context
- **Multigenerational Pattern:** Family history shows consistent pattern of:
  - Protecting male family members from consequences
  - Expecting women to tolerate abuse
  - Scapegoating outsiders (particularly women who challenge the system)
- **Tammy's Hostility:** Stemmed from Ms. Jeffery's advocacy against DV and helping Nephew1's mother leave an abusive relationship
- **Pre-Existing Scapegoating:** Family had banned Ms. Jeffery and her children from Christmas before the incident occurred
- **Double Standard:** Family validated a similar balcony accident involving a blood relative as "accidental" while accusing Ms. Jeffery of "murder"
- **Statistical Impossibility:** Maternal revenge filicide is vanishingly rare (nearly non-existent in research), making the accusation statistically implausible
- **Relationship After Cheating:**
  - Following Tia discovering Adam's cheating, they remained friends and were intimate
  - Tia and Adam were speaking, although at times arguing
  - Tia clearly articulated her intention when sharing Adam's violent/abusive/bad behavior was to help him
  - Tia stated: "Is the parent who take scissors away from a running child a bad parent? The child may cry. And I am sorry youre hurt but it is the right thing to do"
  - Tia and Adam remained close until she was unable to send him money
  - Adam told Tia to see Lily, but when she did, he would insist they have sex
  - Tia was threatened with violence and murder by Adam's mother
  - Adam said these threats were acceptable because Lily died while in Tia's care
  - Adam threatened to take Tia to court if she tried to get custody of Lily and said he would claim she was unsafe
  - Tia has videos of incidents when Adam left her alone with Lily after coercing her into sex and then going out

## Official Investigations
- **WA Police:** "Accidental submersion; no foul play"
- **CPFS:** "No protective concern, matter closed" (Oct 2022)
- **90-min Neglect Claim:** Debunked rumor from hostile aunt

## Legal Precedents
- **TPL (WA 2013):** No criminal liability for brief lapses when hazard in different room
- **Master K (Vic 2021):** 2-3 min supervision lapse ruled accidental
- **R v Patel (Qld 2022):** Tragic outcome â‰  criminal liability without gross negligence
