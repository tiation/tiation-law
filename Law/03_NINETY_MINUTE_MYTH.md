# The "90-Minute" Myth: Anatomy of a Distortion

The claim that the mother left her child alone for 90 minutes exemplifies how bias transforms facts into fiction. This single falsehood has become a cornerstone of the accusation against the mother, despite being demonstrably incorrect.

## Origin as Clerical Error
The "90 minutes" actually referred to the duration of resuscitation efforts, not a period of neglect—a critical administrative error that took on a life of its own. This misattribution was initially recorded in a child protection document without verification.

## Transformation into "Evidence"
Once this error entered official documents, it gained an appearance of authority and became the cornerstone of the false narrative. The mere presence of this timeframe in an official document lent it credibility, despite its inaccuracy.

## Factual Timeline
The actual timeline of events was:
* The mother was absent from the child for only 1-2 minutes
* After finding the child unresponsive, she immediately began resuscitation efforts
* These efforts, combined with emergency response, continued for approximately 90 minutes
* The child had dry hair not because she wasn't in water, but because of normal evaporation during the extended resuscitation period

## Resistance to Correction
Despite contradictory evidence and official determinations of accidental drowning by police and child protection services, this myth persists—demonstrating how confirmation bias overrides factual corrections. Even when presented with the correct timeline, many continue to reference the "90-minute" claim.

## Cost to Truth
This distortion prevents learning from the tragedy to implement effective prevention measures, as energy is diverted to blame rather than understanding the actual circumstances of the accident. The focus on an imagined prolonged absence prevents examination of the real risk factors for infant drowning—which can occur in minutes, not hours.

## Implications for Case Understanding
The persistence of the "90-minute" myth reveals:

1. How initial errors can become foundational to false narratives
2. The power of official documentation to legitimize incorrect information
3. The resistance of emotionally satisfying falsehoods to factual correction
4. The need for rigorous fact-checking in child death investigations

Correcting this single distortion is essential to understanding the true nature of this tragic accident and moving toward prevention rather than blame.
