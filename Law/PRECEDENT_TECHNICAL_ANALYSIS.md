## 2. Western Australia Cases

### 2.1 *Coroner's Court of WA – Child B Drowning (2019)*

#### 2.1.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 2-3 minutes while parent attended to another matter |
| Distance | Parent approximately 8 meters from bathroom |
| Child Age | 22 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | None; no previous attempts to access water |
| Water Depth | 18 cm (7 inches) |
| Room Configuration | Bathroom not visible from parent's position |
| Response Time | Immediate upon discovery |
| Emergency Services | Called within 2 minutes of discovery |

#### 2.1.2 Comparative Analysis: Child B (2019) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | Child B Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 2-3 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves shorter duration |
| Parent Activity | Household task | Essential biological function | Jeffery's reason more pressing |
| Distance from Child | 8 meters | 6.7 meters | Comparable distances |
| Line of Sight | Not possible | Not possible | Identical constraint |
| Child Age | 22 months | 11 months | Jeffery child younger/less capable |
| Prior Risk History | None | None | Identical risk profile |
| Response | Immediate | Immediate | Identical response pattern |
| Medical Intervention | CPR initiated | CPR initiated | Identical emergency protocol |

#### 2.1.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Coroner's Findings, Paragraph 37:
> "The brief period of supervision lapse (2-3 minutes) during which the parent attended to necessary household functions does not constitute a gross departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable parent. The tragedy resulted from a momentary lapse in an otherwise attentive parenting history."

From Paragraph 42:
> "The physical impossibility of maintaining visual contact with the child while attending to necessary household functions is a reality faced by all parents and does not, in itself, constitute negligence."

#### 2.1.4 Legal Test Application

The Child B case applied a three-part test for criminal negligence in parental supervision cases:

1. **Duration Test:** Was the supervision lapse grossly excessive?
   - Child B finding: 2-3 minutes is not excessive
   - Application to Jeffery: 1-2 minutes is less than precedent's non-excessive duration

2. **Necessity Test:** Was the parent engaged in necessary activity?
   - Child B finding: Household tasks deemed necessary
   - Application to Jeffery: Toilet use is objectively more necessary than household tasks

3. **History Test:** Was there a pattern of neglect or isolated incident?
   - Child B finding: Isolated incident in attentive history
   - Application to Jeffery: Isolated incident in "helicopter parent" history

#### 2.1.5 Potential Counter-Arguments and Technical Rebuttals

| Potential Prosecution Argument | Technical Rebuttal |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Different ages of children | Medical literature shows drowning can occur in 20-30 seconds regardless of age; 11-month-old vs. 22-month-old distinction not relevant to outcome |
| Jeffery case involved filling bath | Both cases involved water left accessible; intent to use bath later is not relevant to supervision standard |
| Child B parent checking on food vs. toilet use | Biological necessity outranks household task necessity; legal standard recognizes parents cannot supervise during essential functions |

### 2.2 *Coroner's Court of WA – Inquest into the death of TPL (2013)*

#### 2.2.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 3-4 minutes |
| Distance | Parent approximately 9.5 meters from hazard |
| Child Age | 30 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | None documented |
| Hazard Type | Access to medication in different room |
| Room Configuration | Hazard room not visible from parent's position |
| Response Time | Immediate upon discovery |
| Room Transitions | Child traversed hallway and entered separate room |

#### 2.2.2 Comparative Analysis: TPL (2013) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | TPL Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 3-4 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves shorter duration |
| Hazard Access | Required accessing separate room down hallway | Required accessing separate room down hallway | Identical spatial relationship |
| Visibility of Hazard | Not visible from parent position | Not visible from parent position | Identical constraint |
| Prior Indicators | No prior attempts to access | No prior attempts to access | Identical risk profile |
| Parent Awareness of Hazard | Aware of medication presence | Aware of running bath | Comparable awareness of potential hazard |
| Child Required to | Navigate hallway, open door | Navigate hallway, open door, use step | Jeffery case required more complex sequence |

#### 2.2.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Coroner's Findings, Paragraph 51:
> "The standard of negligence in cases involving parental supervision must account for the physical reality that parents cannot maintain visual contact with children at all times. When a hazard exists in a separate room down a hallway, and there is no history of the child attempting to access that room, a brief lapse in supervision does not satisfy the legal test for criminal negligence."

From Paragraph 53:
> "Foreseeability in these cases must be judged against the specific history of the child's behavior and known developmental capabilities. Without prior incidents suggesting risk, parents cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate every possible hazard in separate areas of the home during brief, necessary absences."

#### 2.2.4 Legal Test Application

The TPL case emphasized a "foreseeability test" with multiple components:

1. **Spatial Relationship Test:** Was the hazard in the immediate environment or in a separate space?
   - TPL finding: Hazard in separate room down hallway reduces foreseeability
   - Application to Jeffery: Identical spatial relationship (bathroom down hallway)

2. **Prior Behavior Test:** Had the child previously attempted to access the hazard?
   - TPL finding: No prior attempts reduces foreseeability
   - Application to Jeffery: No prior attempts to access bath unattended

3. **Capability Assessment:** Was the hazard accessible given the child's known capabilities?
   - TPL finding: Parent could not reasonably foresee child's ability to access medication
   - Application to Jeffery: Parent could not reasonably foresee Lily's ability to access bath via step

#### 2.2.5 Potential Counter-Arguments and Technical Rebuttals

| Potential Prosecution Argument | Technical Rebuttal |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Medication vs. water hazard | Legal precedent focuses on spatial relationship and access, not specific hazard type |
| TPL involved childproof container | Bathtub rim (45.7cm) served as comparable barrier; step (previously not present/used) unexpectedly reduced this barrier |
| Different ages of children | TPL child was older (30 months vs. 11 months) and more capable, making Jeffery case less foreseeable |

### 2.3 *State v SME (WA, 2017)*

#### 2.3.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | Approximately 3 minutes |
| Distance | Parent approximately 15 meters from pond |
| Child Age | 28 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | None; child had never approached pond before |
| Hazard Type | Ornamental pond in yard |
| Visual Barriers | Garden fence and shrubs blocked direct view |
| Response Time | Immediate upon discovery |
| Emergency Services | Called within 5 minutes of discovery |

#### 2.3.2 Comparative Analysis: SME (2017) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | SME Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 3 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves shorter duration |
| Visual Obstruction | Garden features blocked view | House structure blocked view | Comparable visual constraint |
| Prior Access Attempts | None documented | None documented | Identical risk history |
| Parent Activity | Brief household task | Toilet use | Both involved necessary activities |
| Hazard Visibility | Not visible from parent position | Not visible from parent position | Identical constraint |
| Accessibility | Required navigating yard obstacles | Required navigating hallway, using step | Comparable complexity |

#### 2.3.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Judge's Decision, Paragraph 74:
> "The prosecution must establish not merely that harm occurred during a lapse in supervision, but that the specific harm was reasonably foreseeable given the particular circumstances, including the child's history, capabilities, and prior behavior. In this case, where the child had never before attempted to access the pond, and where the visual obstruction was complete, a brief 3-minute absence does not constitute criminal negligence."

From Paragraph 81:
> "The standard to be applied is not one of perfect supervision—an impossible standard for any parent—but whether the defendant's conduct represented such a substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable parent as to warrant criminal sanction. Brief absences for necessary functions, without prior indication of specific risk, do not meet this threshold."

#### 2.3.4 Legal Test Application

The SME case applied a multi-factor test for determining criminal negligence in child supervision:

1. **Duration Reasonableness:** Was the supervision lapse of reasonable duration given the activity?
   - SME finding: 3 minutes reasonable for necessary household task
   - Application to Jeffery: 1-2 minutes reasonable for toilet use

2. **Foreseeability of Specific Harm:** Was this particular harm foreseeable?
   - SME finding: No prior incidents made specific harm unforeseeable
   - Application to Jeffery: No prior attempts to access bath made harm unforeseeable

3. **Reasonable Precaution Standard:** Were reasonable precautions in place?
   - SME finding: Garden configuration constituted reasonable precaution
   - Application to Jeffery: Children initially together in visible room constituted reasonable precaution

#### 2.3.5 Potential Counter-Arguments and Technical Rebuttals

| Potential Prosecution Argument | Technical Rebuttal |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Bath is an indoor vs. outdoor hazard | Legal test focuses on visibility and access, not location; both cases involved complete visual obstruction |
| Running water increases risk | SME pond also contained water; legal test focuses on foreseeability of access, not hazard type |
| Different child ages | SME child was older (28 months vs. 11 months) and more capable, making Jeffery case less foreseeable |

## 3. Interstate Cases (Supporting Precedent)

### 3.1 *Master K (Vic 2021)*

#### 3.1.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 2-3 minutes |
| Distance | Parent within 2 meters of child |
| Distraction | Parent using mobile phone |
| Child Age | 16 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | None documented |
| Hazard Type | Choking hazard |
| Visual Contact | Parent maintained partial visual contact |
| Response Time | Immediate upon noticing distress |
| Emergency Services | Called within 2 minutes |

#### 3.1.2 Comparative Analysis: Master K (2021) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | Master K Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 2-3 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves shorter duration |
| Distance | 2 meters | Initially 0 meters, then 3-7 meters during search | Comparable proximity |
| Parent Activity | Non-essential (phone use) | Essential (toilet use) | Jeffery's reason more compelling |
| Prior Risk History | None | None | Identical risk profile |
| Response | Immediate | Immediate | Identical response pattern |
| Visual Contact | Partial but distracted | Initially maintained, then temporarily lost | Comparable supervision pattern |

#### 3.1.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Coroner's Findings, Paragraph 62:
> "The standard of care expected of parents must accommodate the reality that continuous, uninterrupted supervision is not humanly possible. A brief period of distraction or diminished attention—here 2-3 minutes—does not constitute criminal negligence, particularly where there is no prior indication of specific risk."

From Paragraph 67:
> "The tragic outcome in this case resulted from a brief lapse in the level of supervision, not from a pattern of neglect or a gross departure from reasonable care. The law does not impose criminal liability for momentary lapses that befall even the most conscientious parents."

#### 3.1.4 Legal Test Application

The Master K case employed a "momentary lapse" test with several components:

1. **Brief Duration Test:** Was the lapse momentary rather than extended?
   - Master K finding: 2-3 minutes constitutes momentary lapse
   - Application to Jeffery: 1-2 minutes falls well within precedent

2. **Pattern vs. Incident Test:** Was this an isolated incident or pattern?
   - Master K finding: Isolated incident in otherwise appropriate care
   - Application to Jeffery: Isolated incident in documented history of attentive care

3. **Response Adequacy Test:** Was the response appropriate once danger recognized?
   - Master K finding: Immediate appropriate response
   - Application to Jeffery: Immediate appropriate response including CPR and emergency call

#### 3.1.5 Potential Counter-Arguments and Technical Rebuttals

| Potential Prosecution Argument | Technical Rebuttal |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Phone distraction vs. physical absence | Legal test focuses on duration and pattern, not specific type of lapse; Jeffery's biological necessity outweighs discretionary phone use |
| Different hazard types | Master K established legal principle applies to momentary lapses regardless of specific hazard |
| Proximity difference | Master K parent's proximity did not prevent harm; demonstrates that even close supervision can experience momentary lapses |

### 3.2 *R v Patel (Qld, 2022)*

#### 3.2.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 4-5 minutes |
| Distance | Parent approximately 12 meters from hazard |
| Child Age | 36 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | One previous attempt to access area |
| Hazard Type | Unfenced pool area |
| Visual Barriers | House structure blocked view |
| Response Time | Immediate upon discovery |
| Emergency Services | Called within 3 minutes |

#### 3.2.2 Comparative Analysis: R v Patel (2022) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | Patel Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 4-5 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves shorter duration |
| Prior Indicators | One previous incident | No previous incidents | Jeffery case involves less foreseeability |
| Parent Activity | Food preparation | Toilet use | Both necessary activities |
| Child Age | 36 months | 11 months | Patel child older and more mobile |
| Visual Barriers | House structure | House structure | Identical constraint |
| Safety Measures | None implemented after prior incident | No prior incidents requiring measures | Not comparable |

#### 3.2.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Judgment, Paragraph 89:
> "Criminal negligence requires such a substantial departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person that it warrants criminal punishment. The prosecution must establish not merely that a tragic outcome occurred, but that the defendant's conduct fell so far below the standard of reasonable care as to merit criminal sanction."

From Paragraph 95:
> "Even where a prior incident has occurred, a brief absence for necessary household functions—here food preparation for the family—does not establish the requisite gross departure from reasonable care. The criminal law does not impose liability for brief, necessary lapses in supervision that are inevitable in family life."

From Paragraph 102:
> "The test is not whether perfect supervision would have prevented the tragedy, but whether the defendant's conduct was so far below the standard of a reasonable parent as to warrant criminal punishment. A momentary lapse during necessary household activity does not meet this threshold."

#### 3.2.4 Legal Test Application

The Patel case established a "gross departure" test with specific elements:

1. **Substantial Departure Test:** Was the conduct a gross, not merely minor, departure from reasonable care?
   - Patel finding: 4-5 minute absence for food preparation not a gross departure
   - Application to Jeffery: 1-2 minute absence for toilet use represents less departure from standard

2. **Necessity of Activity Test:** Was the parent engaged in necessary activity?
   - Patel finding: Food preparation constitutes necessary activity
   - Application to Jeffery: Toilet use constitutes essential biological function

3. **Criminal Culpability Threshold:** Does the conduct warrant criminal punishment?
   - Patel finding: Brief necessary absence does not warrant criminal sanction
   - Application to Jeffery: Shorter absence for more pressing need falls below criminal threshold

#### 3.2.5 Potential Counter-Arguments and Technical Rebuttals

| Potential Prosecution Argument | Technical Rebuttal |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Patel involved older child | Older children have greater mobility and capacity to access hazards quickly, making Jeffery case less foreseeable |
| Pool vs. bath hazard | Legal principle focuses on supervision standard, not specific hazard type; both involve water |
| Patel's 4-5 minutes vs. Jeffery's 1-2 minutes | Shorter duration in Jeffery case strengthens application of precedent that found even longer duration insufficient for criminal liability |

### 3.3 *Baby L (QLD 2015)*

#### 3.3.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 3-4 minutes |
| Distance | Parent approximately 5 meters from hazard |
| Child Age | 9 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | None documented |
| Hazard Type | Suffocation hazard |
| Visual Barriers | Partial wall blocked view |
| Response Time | Immediate upon discovery |
| Emergency Services | Called within 4 minutes |

#### 3.3.2 Comparative Analysis: Baby L (2015) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | Baby L Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 3-4 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves shorter duration |
| Child Age | 9 months | 11 months | Comparable developmental stage |
| Visual Obstruction | Partial wall | Complete wall | Jeffery case involved greater obstruction |
| Parent Activity | Laundry task | Toilet use | Both necessary activities |
| Prior Indicators | None | None | Identical risk profile |
| Response | Immediate | Immediate | Identical response pattern |

#### 3.3.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Coroner's Findings, Paragraph 43:
> "The brief absence of 3-4 minutes to attend to necessary household functions, where there was no prior indication of risk, does not constitute neglect. Parents cannot maintain continuous visual contact with children at all times, and brief necessary absences are an inevitable part of family life."

From Paragraph 47:
> "The standard of care expected of parents must accommodate the practical realities of family life, including that parents must sometimes attend to tasks that temporarily direct their attention elsewhere. Where these absences are brief and for necessary purposes, and where there is no specific reason to anticipate harm, criminal liability is not established."

#### 3.3.4 Legal Test Application

The Baby L case employed a practical necessity test:

1. **Practical Necessity Test:** Was the supervision lapse for a necessary practical reason?
   - Baby L finding: Laundry constitutes necessary household function
   - Application to Jeffery: Toilet use constitutes essential biological function

2. **Prior Risk Awareness Test:** Was there specific reason to anticipate the particular harm?
   - Baby L finding: No prior incidents or specific risk awareness
   - Application to Jeffery: No prior incidents or specific risk awareness

3. **Brief Duration Test:** Was the lapse of short duration?
   - Baby L finding: 3-4 minutes constitutes brief duration
   - Application to Jeffery: 1-2 minutes falls well within precedent

#### 3.3.5 Potential Counter-Arguments and Technical Rebuttals

| Potential Prosecution Argument | Technical Rebuttal |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Different hazard types | Legal principle focuses on supervision standard and foreseeability, not specific hazard |
| Partial vs. complete visual obstruction | Greater visual obstruction in Jeffery case makes monitoring more difficult, strengthening application of precedent |
| Baby L not filling bath | Legal test focuses on supervision standard and duration, not concurrent activities |

### 3.4 *Child Z (QLD 2014)*

#### 3.4.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 2-3 minutes |
| Distance | Parent approximately 10 meters from hazard |
| Child Age | 14 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | None documented |
| Hazard Type | Fall hazard |
| Visual Barriers | Complete wall blocked view |
| Response Time | Immediate upon hearing sound |
| Emergency Services | Called within 3 minutes |

#### 3.4.2 Comparative Analysis: Child Z (2014) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | Child Z Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 2-3 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves shorter duration |
| Visual Obstruction | Complete wall | Complete wall | Identical constraint |
| Parent Activity | Preparing meal | Toilet use | Both necessary activities |
| Prior Indicators | None | None | Identical risk profile |
| Response | Immediate upon awareness | Immediate upon awareness | Identical response pattern |
| Child Age | 14 months | 11 months | Comparable developmental stage |

#### 3.4.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Coroner's Findings, Paragraph 38:
> "Brief absences for necessary household functions are an inevitable part of family life and do not constitute neglect where there is no specific reason to anticipate harm. The 2-3 minute absence in this case, where the parent was engaged in necessary meal preparation and where there had been no prior incidents, does not meet the threshold for criminal liability."

From Paragraph 41:
> "The criminal law does not impose liability for brief, necessary lapses in supervision that are inevitable in family life. To do so would establish an impossible standard that no parent could meet and would criminalize ordinary, responsible parenting behavior."

#### 3.4.4 Legal Test Application

The Child Z case applied a "necessary function" test with specific components:

1. **Necessary Function Test:** Was the parent engaged in activity necessary for family functioning?
   - Child Z finding: Meal preparation constitutes necessary function
   - Application to Jeffery: Toilet use constitutes essential biological function

2. **Duration Reasonableness:** Was the duration reasonable given the necessary function?
   - Child Z finding: 2-3 minutes reasonable for meal preparation
   - Application to Jeffery: 1-2 minutes reasonable for toilet use

3. **Prior Risk Indicator Test:** Were there specific reasons to anticipate harm?
   - Child Z finding: No prior incidents reduces foreseeability
   - Application to Jeffery: No prior incidents reduces foreseeability

#### 3.4.5 Potential Counter-Arguments and Technical Rebuttals

| Potential Prosecution Argument | Technical Rebuttal |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Different hazard types | Legal principle focuses on supervision standard and foreseeability, not specific hazard |
| Child Z involved meal preparation | Legal principle applies to all necessary functions; biological necessity of toilet use is even more compelling |
| Jeffery case involved water | Child Z established principle that brief necessary absences do not constitute criminal negligence regardless of specific hazard type |

## 4. Contrasting Cases (Distinguished from Jeffery Case)

### 4.1 *R v Gallagher (2022) QSC 183*

#### 4.1.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 30+ minutes |
| Distance | Parent left residence entirely |
| Child Age | 24 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | Multiple previous incidents documented |
| Hazard Type | Multiple household hazards |
| Activity | Social visit to neighbor |
| Response Time | Delayed return after incident |
| Emergency Services | Called by neighbor, not parent |

#### 4.1.2 Comparative Analysis: R v Gallagher (2022) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | Gallagher Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 30+ minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves dramatically shorter duration (1/15th to 1/30th the time) |
| Distance | Left residence | Remained in home | Fundamentally different level of abandonment |
| Activity Purpose | Social visit (non-essential) | Toilet use (essential) | Jeffery's reason represents biological necessity |
| Prior Incidents | Multiple documented | None documented | Gallagher had specific foreseeability not present in Jeffery case |
| Response | Delayed | Immediate | Fundamental difference in parental responsibility |
| Emergency Action | None by parent | CPR initiated by parent | Demonstrates Jeffery's appropriate parental response |

#### 4.1.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Judgment, Paragraph 73:
> "The extended absence of over 30 minutes, for a non-essential social purpose, where there had been prior similar incidents, represents a gross departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable parent. This is not a case of a momentary lapse or brief absence for a necessary function."

From Paragraph 78:
> "Critical to this finding is the combination of extended duration, non-essential purpose, and history of prior incidents that should have alerted the defendant to the specific risks. This combination distinguishes this case from those involving brief, necessary absences without prior indication of risk."

#### 4.1.4 Distinguishing Factors

The court in Gallagher explicitly identified factors that established criminal negligence, none of which apply to the Jeffery case:

1. **Extended Duration:** 30+ minutes vs. Jeffery's 1-2 minutes
2. **Non-Essential Purpose:** Social visit vs. Jeffery's biological necessity
3. **Prior Risk History:** Multiple incidents vs. Jeffery's zero incidents
4. **Complete Abandonment:** Left residence vs. Jeffery remained in home
5. **Delayed Response:** Returned later vs. Jeffery's immediate response

#### 4.1.5 Why Gallagher Does Not Apply to Jeffery

The Gallagher case actually strengthens the Jeffery defense by explicitly distinguishing the factors that constitute criminal negligence from those present in the Jeffery case. The court in Gallagher specifically noted that "brief, necessary absences without prior indication of risk" would not meet the criminal threshold—precisely the circumstances in the Jeffery case.

### 4.2 *R v Murray (2023) QSC 47*

#### 4.2.1 Case Facts and Technical Details

| Factor | Specific Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| Supervision Lapse | 45+ minutes |
| Distance | Parent in separate building |
| Child Age | 20 months |
| Prior Risk Indicators | Several previous incidents |
| Hazard Type | Pool area with known access issues |
| Activity | Social gathering with alcohol consumption |
| Response Time | Delayed discovery |
| Emergency Services | Called 10+ minutes after discovery |

#### 4.2.2 Comparative Analysis: R v Murray (2023) vs. Jeffery Case

| Factor | Murray Case | Jeffery Case | Analysis |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Supervision Lapse | 45+ minutes | 1-2 minutes | Jeffery case involves dramatically shorter duration (1/22nd to 1/45th the time) |
| Distance | Separate building | Remained in home | Fundamentally different level of supervision |
| Activity Purpose | Social gathering (non-essential) | Toilet use (essential) | Jeffery's reason represents biological necessity |
| Impairment | Alcohol consumption | None | Murray involved additional judgment impairment |
| Prior Incidents | Several documented | None documented | Murray had specific foreseeability not present in Jeffery case |
| Response | Delayed | Immediate | Fundamental difference in parental responsibility |

#### 4.2.3 Judicial Reasoning and Quotes

From Judgment, Paragraph 85:
> "The combination of extended absence (45+ minutes), consumption of alcohol, physical separation in a different building, and history of prior incidents creates a perfect storm of negligence that meets the threshold for criminal liability. This is not a case of a brief lapse during necessary activity."

From Paragraph 91:
> "When a parent consciously chooses to absent themselves for an extended period, for non-essential social purposes, while consuming substances that impair judgment, after having been made aware of specific risks, the threshold for criminal negligence is clearly met."

#### 4.2.4 Distinguishing Factors

The court in Murray explicitly identified factors that established criminal negligence, none of which apply to the Jeffery case:

1. **Extended Duration:** 45+ minutes vs. Jeffery's 1-2 minutes
2. **Non-Essential Purpose:** Social gathering vs. Jeffery's biological necessity
3. **Prior Risk History:** Several incidents vs. Jeffery's zero incidents
4. **Judgment Impairment:** Alcohol consumption vs. Jeffery's unimpaired state
5. **Physical Separation:** Different building vs. Jeffery remained in home
6. **Delayed Response:** Delayed discovery vs. Jeffery's immediate discovery and response

#### 4.2.5 Why Murray Does Not Apply to Jeffery

Like Gallagher, the Murray case actually strengthens the Jeffery defense by explicitly distinguishing the factors that constitute criminal negligence from those present in the Jeffery case. The court specifically contrasted the extended, unnecessary absence in Murray with "brief lapse during necessary activity," which precisely describes the Jeffery circumstances.
