# Case Chronology: Tia L. Jeffery

## Detailed Incident Timeline
- **Before 7:36 AM**: 
  - Ms. Jeffery and her children (11-month-old Lily and 7-year-old Joshua) were playing together in bed
  - Lily had her morning bottle and was in good spirits
  - Ms. Jeffery undressed Lily for her bath (Lily was known to enjoy being "nudy rudy" as part of the routine)
  - Ms. Jeffery turned on the bath water to begin filling the tub (a routine practice to help clear Lily's congestion)
- **7:36 AM**: 
  - Ms. Jeffery was menstruating and needed the restroom. The usual practice is carry Lily to her's and brother Joshua's room to supervise while using the restroom.
  - Placed Lily there to play while Ms. Jeffery used the bathroom
  - Ms. Jeffery entered the toilet with full sight-line to Joshua's room where she believed Lily remained
- **7:37 AM**: 
  - Ms. Jeffery realizes Lily is no longer visible in Joshua's room
  - **Immediately searches and finds Lily in the bath (time frame of unsupervised access was less than a minute, maximum 2 minutes)**
- **7:37-7:40 AM**: 
  - Ms. Jeffery pulls Lily from the bath
  - Instinctively pulls the bath plug while retrieving Lily
  - Immediately picks up Lily and holds her to her chest
  - Upon finding Lily unresponsive, Ms. Jeffery carefully lays her face forward on her knees, cupping around her chin to support her neck, and pats her back (a technique she had seen in a Christian movie where a nurse saves a child at a restaurant)
  - While continuing this resuscitation efforts, frantically searches for her phone with her eyes
  - Lays Lily down in her bedroom to call 000
  - Follows emergency dispatcher's instructions for CPR
- **7:40 AM**: Emergency call placed to 000
  - During the call, Ms. Jeffery stated "she can't breathe" and in attempting to explain the situation said "I left her in the bath it was just an accident"
  - These statements were made while trying to quickly convey information to first responders
  - Important context: Ms. Jeffery did not physically place Lily in the bath; the statement reflects her tendency to assume excessive responsibility in crisis situations
- **~7:50 AM**: 
  - Upon hearing the ambulance, Ms. Jeffery attempted to run to the front of the home to meet paramedics, briefly pausing CPR only while changing location
  - The ambulance relocated to the back of the home
  - Ms. Jeffery resumed CPR immediately and continued efforts
- **7:52 AM**: Ambulance gains entry (delay due to locked gate)
  - Ms. Jeffery continued CPR until paramedics took over

## Ms. Jeffery's Personal Testimony
- **Time Frame**: "The time frame was less than a minute. Max 2."
- **CPR Knowledge**: "I had never done CPR. I had no knowledge except what my father told me: you don't stop. Which I didn't."
- **Following Instructions**: "I did what they told me" (referring to emergency dispatcher instructions)
- **Subsequent Realization**: "I learned in a course I took immediately after this incident I had incorrect technique as I thought I needed to breathe for her. I didn't understand her heart wasn't started."
- **Reflection**: "I did what they said however I feel understanding of the mechanism could have saved my baby."
- **Post-Incident Action**: Ms. Jeffery took a CPR course immediately after the incident, demonstrating her commitment to being better prepared in the future.

## Important Contextual Details
- The bath routine was normal practice to help with Lily's congestion
- Lily had never previously accessed the bathroom unsupervised
- Lily was nude at the time of the incident ("nudy rudy"), which explains the absence of wet clothing evidence
- The bathroom was down the hallway, completely out of line of sight from the toilet
- Baby gates had already been delivered by the children's grandparents, Diana and Terry
- Installation of the gates was expected to be completed by Adam (Lily's father)
- Negotiations regarding the installation were in progress
- Ms. Jeffery attempted multiple resuscitation techniques, demonstrating her desperate efforts to save Lily
- Her resuscitation technique was based on a method she had seen in a Christian movie and advice from her father - showing her attempt to use any knowledge available to her in the emergency
- She maintained focus on helping Lily while simultaneously trying to call for emergency assistance
- Ms. Jeffery has been described as a "helicopter parent" with no history of neglect

## Communication Patterns and Crisis Response
- Ms. Jeffery struggles with precise sentence formation, particularly in high-stress situations
- She demonstrates a pattern of assuming excessive responsibility, often beyond what circumstances warrant
- During the 000 call, her statement "I left her in the bath" was an attempt to quickly convey information to first responders
- This communication pattern is significant as it explains why she may have used language that incorrectly implied direct action on her part
- Her statements during crisis situations should be understood within this context of over-assuming responsibility
- This pattern is consistent with her protective parenting style and intense sense of duty toward her children

## Post-Incident Events
1. Lily placed on life support with brain-stem-only function
2. Ms. Jeffery requests hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and high-flow Oâ‚‚
3. Ethics panel refuses HBOT as "non-evidence-based, futile"
4. Ms. Jeffery continues daily appeals for HBOT, offers to fund privately
5. Lily remains on life support in persistent vegetative state
6. **Ms. Jeffery took a CPR course immediately after the incident**

## Investigation and Legal Proceedings
1. Initial CPFS draft memo (based on statement from hostile aunt Tammy) alleged 90-minute neglect
2. WA Police Homicide brief concludes "Accidental submersion; no foul play"
3. CPFS final letter (Oct 2022) states "No protective concern, matter closed"
4. Despite these findings, charges filed under Section 101(1) of the Children and Community Services Act 2004 (WA)
5. Current status: Case pending in District Court of Western Australia

## Family Dynamics Context
- Children's grandparents: Diana and Terry (had delivered the baby gates)
- Lily's father: Adam (was expected to install the gates)
- Joshua: Lily's 7-year-old brother
- Aunt Tammy: Source of the initial allegation of 90-minute neglect (later disproven)

## Defense Strategy Timeline
1. **Establish accurate timeline (less than 1 minute, maximum 2-minute lapse)**
2. Present floor plan showing bathroom was not visible from toilet
3. Challenge "dry hair/empty bath" observations with scientific explanations:
   - Bath was empty because Ms. Jeffery instinctively pulled the plug when retrieving Lily
   - Lily's hair appeared dry because:
     - She was nude at the time of the incident
     - Toweling and air flow for 10-12 minutes dried her infant vellus hair
     - Movement during carrying downstairs further fanned evaporation
4. Document Ms. Jeffery's history of protective parenting
5. Present evidence of ongoing safety measures (baby gates already delivered and installation planned)
6. Emphasize Ms. Jeffery's immediate and desperate resuscitation efforts:
   - Holding Lily to her chest
   - Attempting the back-patting technique she recalled from a movie
   - Following her father's advice to "not stop" CPR
   - Following emergency dispatcher's instructions despite lack of prior training
   - Only briefly interrupting CPR when attempting to direct emergency services
7. **Highlight Ms. Jeffery's proactive approach to taking a CPR course immediately after the incident**
8. Present relevant legal precedents showing similar cases resulted in findings of accidental death
