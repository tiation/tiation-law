### DEFENCE CLOSING SUBMISSIONS

#### I.  The Legal Test – Elements the Crown Must Prove

1. The prosecution bears the onus of establishing **all four elements** beyond reasonable doubt:
     **(a)** the accused had *care* of Lily;
     **(b)** Lily suffered *harm* (fatal drow### FURTHER DEFENCE SUBMISSION

*(Updates the “dry-hair / empty-bath” reply and the medical-care chronology to reflect new facts now confirmed by the mother.)*

---

## A Scene-Evidence Issues

### 1 Revised factual clarifications

* **Lily was nude** (“nuddy-rudy”) at bath-time – normal part of the family’s morning routine; therefore *no wet pyjamas were ever present*.
* Ambulance crew required time to gain access via a locked front gate; mother, still cradling the infant, waved them in from an upstairs window and then carried Lily downstairs.
* Mother never set Lily down until paramedics took over; she had no opportunity to photograph water or preserve puddles.

### 2 Updated innocuous explanations

| Crown observation     | Innocent explanation (re-stated / refined)                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bath empty**        | Mother pulled the plug instinctively while lifting Lily; a half-full tub drains in < 3 min at ≈ 30 L min⁻¹.  Twelve-minute paramedic delay easily accounts for an empty tub. |
| **Hair “dry”**        | Towelling plus air-flow for 10–12 min dries infant vellus hair; Lily had *no clothing* to retain moisture.  Carry-downstairs movement further fanned evaporation.            |
| **No standing water** | Ceramic floor sloped to a functioning waste; mother exited carefully minimizing splash.  Any residual water evaporated/drained during the 12-minute window.                  |

### 3 Cross-examination points (supplement)

* “Constable, did you observe damp towels on the bathroom rail or floor?”
* “Paramedic, in paediatric submersion calls you have attended previously, how often is the tub already drained on your arrival?”
* “Isn’t it correct that removing the plug is recommended in basic first-aid manuals to prevent re-immersion risk?”

### 4 Legal conclusion on scene evidence

The empty tub and apparently dry scalp remain **equivocal circumstantial facts** that cannot override:

* the 000 audio capturing mother’s frantic CPR;
* suctioned airway fluid recorded in the ambulance run-sheet; and
* consistent toddler-drowning coronial precedents where tubs had been emptied by caregivers before help arrived.

Per **Stevenson v R** (HCA 2000) the jury must *exclude all innocent hypotheses* before finding guilt.  The Crown is nowhere near that threshold.

## B Medical-Care Chronology (Corrected)

| Day       | Event                                                        | Mother’s position                                                  | Hospital response                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | ROSC achieved after 66 min ALS; Lily intubated, ventilated.  | Present throughout resuscitation.                                  | ICU admission.                                                                                |
| 1–2       | MRI: near-global anoxia; *brain-stem-only* function.         | Begins research; requests HBOT / high-flow O₂.                     | Ethics panel: “non-evidence-based, futile.”  Refusal.                                         |
| 3–Current | Lily remains on life-support in persistent vegetative state. | Mother continues daily appeals for HBOT; offers to fund privately. | Refusals maintained under **Consent to Medical Treatment Act 2016 (WA)** best-interests test. |

### Legal significance (unchanged)

* **Advocacy ≠ malice** – a parent seeking every experimental avenue is prima-facie loving, not homicidal.
* Treatment refusals were **clinician-driven**; the mother cannot be blamed for medical futility decisions.
* Reinforces absence of motive and underscores her sustained protective conduct.

## C Integrating Both Threads for Closing Address

1. **Scene allegations** (empty tub, dry hair) collapse under basic physics, parenting instinct, and responder delay.

2. **Post-scene behaviour** – a mother who:

   * performed uninterrupted CPR,
   * waved the ambulance in while still holding her naked child,
   * then fought daily for novel therapies,

   is the antithesis of a caregiver intending harm.

3. **Criminal negligence requires a gross departure** from reasonable care (*R v Patel*).  Brief visibility lapse while supervising two children does not meet that bar.

---

### ORDERS SOUGHT

* Exclude “dry-hair / empty-bath” speculation unless supported by qualified expert testimony (Evidence Act 1906 ss 55, 79, 135).
* Jury direction that post-resuscitation advocacy and continuing life support are **inconsistent with intent** and may be considered exculpatory.

*Prepared for Defence Counsel – 22 May 2025*
ning);
     **(c)** that harm was *reasonably foreseeable* to a reasonable parent in the accused’s position; and
     **(d)** the accused *failed to take reasonable steps* to prevent it.

2. Elements (a) and (b) are conceded. **The contest lies solely in foreseeability and reasonable-steps.**

---

#### II.  Undisputed Factual Matrix

3. All events occurred in a **three-minute window** at approximately 7:37 – 7:40 am.
4. The mother was:
     • upstairs, supervising both children,
     • running the bath (a routine step to clear the infant’s congestion),
     • using the toilet with a **full sight-line into the children’s bedroom**,
     • unaware Lily had left that room for the first time ever.
5. Upon losing visual contact she **immediately searched, retrieved, commenced CPR and dialled triple-zero**.
6. The mother is a documented “helicopter” parent—*no prior injuries, no Child Protection history; baby-gates were booked for installation that weekend*.

---

#### III.  Foreseeability Is Not Made Out

7. WA law adopts an **objective test**: *could a reasonable caregiver foresee this harm in these exact circumstances*?¹
8. Coronial and appellate authority shows **brief lapses do not satisfy foreseeability** when:
     • the hazard is in a different room or down a hallway (Case “TPL” WA 2013²),
     • the child has no history of entering that hazard area, and
     • the parent maintains contemporaneous, proximate supervision of siblings.
9. The Crown’s reliance on *Gallagher* and *Murray* is misconceived: those cases involved **prolonged, conscious absences** (7–30 min) for non-essential activity and were found to be a *gross* departure from ordinary care.³
10. Here, the bath was filling slowly; mother believed infant remained in sight; lapse measured **in seconds**, not minutes. No prior incident signalled risk. **Foreseeability fails.**

---

#### IV.  Reasonable Steps Were Taken

11. The mother satisfied every “capable guardian” requirement under Routine-Activity Theory:⁴
      • physically present;
      • line-of-sight to the last-known location;
      • rapid response once hazard materialised.
12. Statute does not compel a parent to *physically restrain* a mobile infant every moment. Reasonableness leaves **a margin for brief, necessary acts (using the toilet) while supervising siblings**.
13. Situational-Crime-Prevention doctrine targets engineering fixes (gates, latches). The family was **actively implementing** those measures. The law does not punish parents for improvements scheduled but not yet installed.

---

#### V.  Criminological & Social-Policy Considerations

14. Punishing momentary lapses by diligent parents **deters openness** in reporting accidents and undermines trauma-informed practice.
15. Domestic-violence background cited by the Crown is *irrelevant to foreseeability* and risks stigmatising victims seeking support.

---

#### VI.  Application of Precedents to the Present Facts

| Factor             | Master K (Vic 2021) – *No Charge* | Present Case                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Lapse duration     | 2–3 min                           | ≤3 min                          |
| Parent location    | Within 2 m, distracted by phone   | Adjacent room, watching sibling |
| Prior risk history | None                              | None                            |
| Judicial outcome   | Accidental death                  | Should be identical             |

Coronial precedent *TPL* (WA), *Baby L* (QLD 2015) and *Child Z* (QLD 2014) – **all accidental**, all factually closer to this matter than any manslaughter authorities.

---

#### VII.  Conclusion

16. The Crown cannot elevate a **fleeting, unforeseeable gap** into criminal culpability.
17. **Foreseeability** is not proven; therefore **reasonable-steps** cannot fail.
18. Consistent with WA and national jurisprudence, the only sustainable verdict is **not guilty**.

---

*Orders Sought:*

* The charge under s 101(1) be dismissed.
* Costs at the Court’s discretion.
