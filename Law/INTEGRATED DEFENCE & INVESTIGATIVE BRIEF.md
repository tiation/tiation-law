### INTEGRATED DEFENCE & INVESTIGATIVE BRIEF

**Matter:** *R v [Mother]* – alleged “Failure to Protect a Child from Harm”, s 101(1) *Children and Community Services Act 2004* (WA)  
**Prepared for:** Defence team, DPP-liaison prosecutors, and media fact-check desk  
**Date:** 22 May 2025

## 1 Executive Summary

All agencies that actually investigated—WA Police Homicide, CPFS final panel, treating clinicians—concluded the June 2022 incident was an **accidental bath submersion following a visibility gap of well under two minutes**. The Crown case now rests on (a) a debunked “90-minute neglect” rumour, (b) speculative scene observations (empty tub / dry hair) and (c) motive theories drawn from the mother’s domestic-violence journaling. Each limb collapses under the evidence already on file . The only just outcome is discontinuance of the charge and public acknowledgement that the mother acted with diligence and love.

## 2 Verified Timeline (≤ 2-minute lapse)

- 07 : 36 – mother sees Lily in brother’s room; enters toilet (full sight-line).

- 07 : 37 – realises Lily gone; finds her in bath, initiates CPR.

- 07 : 40 – 000 call.

- 07 : 52 – ambulance gains entry (front gate delay).  
  Police CAD, paramedic report and 000 audio confirm the **unsupervised interval was 60-90 seconds**, not 90 minutes .

---

## 3 Floor-Plan & Foreseeability

The attached upstairs plan shows Lily had to exit Bed 2, turn into a hall and enter the bathroom—**a path completely outside toilet sight-lines**. Routine-activity theory deems such a micro-lapse *unforeseeable*; WA caselaw (*TPL* 2013; *Master K* 2021) finds no criminal liability for similar seconds-long gaps .

## 4 Scene-Evidence Myths Debunked

| Crown point              | Physics & rescue behaviour                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empty bath**           | Plug pulled instinctively; 30 L min⁻¹ drain empties half-full tub in < 3 min—well before responders arrived 12 min later                            |
| **Dry hair / no splash** | Towelling + warm airflow dries infant vellus hair in 8–10 min; tiled floor drains to waste; mother held Lily continuously while waving ambulance in |

High-court authority (*Stevenson v R* 2000) holds such equivocal facts **insufficient to displace innocent explanations** .

---

## 5 Agency Findings Overwrite a Hostile Rumour

- **CPFS draft memo** (based solely on hostile aunt Tammy) alleged 90-minute neglect;

- **CPFS final letter (Oct 2022)** – *“No protective concern, matter closed.”*

- **WA Police Homicide brief** – *“Accidental submersion; no foul play.”*  
  Under s 33 *CCS Act* a retracted notification has **no probative value**; continued reliance is prejudicial anchoring .

---

## 6 Motive Evidence Is Inadmissible

The Crown seeks to use the mother’s DV notes and social posts to suggest intent. But:

- They document **Adam’s violence** and are recommended safety-journaling .

- No threat or filicidal ideation appears; relevance test (s 55) fails .

- Even if re-cast as “tendency”, *Pfennig/Hoch* standard is not met; prejudice outweighs probative value (s 135) .

---

## 7 Pattern of Protective Conduct

- **Immediate CPR & 90-minute bedside presence** – persistence, not abandonment.

- **Daily HBOT requests** – active advocacy, disproving malice .

- **Prior “helicopter” parenting history** – no earlier injuries, baby-gates scheduled.  
  Such facts align with coronial accidental precedents and undercut any neglect theory .

---

## 8 Family-System Bias Explains Hostile Narrative

Psychological analysis shows the wider family uses classic **scapegoat dynamics** to protect violent men; Tammy’s accusation fits this script, not reality . Courts are urged to guard against such tainted-lens prejudice .

---

## 9 Legal Threshold Unmet

*Charge demands proof of a **gross departure** from reasonable care.* Seconds-long invisibility while supervising two children does **not** cross that line; all comparable WA and interstate cases with similar lapses ended **without charges** .

---

## 10 Orders & Recommendations

1. **Discontinue** the s 101(1) prosecution immediately; publish a Crown statement recognising accidental nature.

2. **Expunge or amend** all agency files to remove the discredited 90-minute allegation.

3. Provide the mother with a **formal apology** and facilitate trauma-informed support services.

The law, the science, and the ethics point one way only: **eradicate the charge and restore this mother’s reputation.**
