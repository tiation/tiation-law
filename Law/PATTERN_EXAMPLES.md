# Pattern Examples: Male Protection & Female Scapegoating
## Concrete Examples from the Family History

This document provides specific examples from the family history that demonstrate the longstanding patterns of:
1. Protecting male family members from consequences
2. Expecting women to tolerate abuse
3. Scapegoating outsiders (particularly women who challenge the system)

## 1. Historical Examples of Male Protection

### Great-grandpa â†’ Grandpa Violence
- **Pattern**: Great-grandpa beat Grandpa every day but did not beat his 4 sisters
- **Protection Mechanism**: This male-on-male violence was normalized and accepted
- **Impact**: Established violence as an acceptable part of male experience

### Grandpa's Alcoholism and Infidelity
- **Pattern**: Grandpa was alcoholic during children's childhood and cheated many times
- **Protection Mechanism**: His behavior was tolerated, managed by his wife
- **Recent Example**: Even recently, Grandpa touched another woman's breast and buttocks without consequences
- **Impact**: Established that male sexual misconduct has no meaningful consequences

### Grandpa's Son1's Violence
- **Pattern**: Regularly beaten by father, became a DV perpetrator in teens and 20s
- **Protection Mechanism**: Family supported him despite abandoning girlfriend and baby
- **Current Status**: Now remarried to a much younger woman and considered "okay" by family
- **Impact**: Demonstrates that men can "move on" from abusive behavior without accountability

### Grandpa's Son2's Escalating Violence
- **Pattern**: Quiet, reserved, considered kind, volunteers with children, yet convicted as serial killer
- **Early Warning**: Was a 'creeper' in youth, would enter women's homes and masturbate
- **Escalation**: First attacked a woman, dragging her to a restroom, but charge was lowered to common assault
- **Ultimate Violence**: Picked up women in affluent area, tied them up, raped and murdered them
- **Protection Mechanism**: Person A (his sister) insists he is innocent despite conviction
- **Impact**: Even extreme violence by male family members is denied or excused

### Son1SonNephew1's DV Behavior
- **Pattern**: Some domestic violence including smashing glass table, slamming door into ex while she held their baby
- **Additional Violence**: Harmed his ex's son by hitting him in the head and tormenting him (only in private)
- **Protection Mechanism**: Family supports him, blames his ex (Tia) for the child's accidental death
- **Impact**: Continues intergenerational pattern of protecting abusive men

## 2. Examples of Women Expected to Tolerate Abuse

### Grandpa's Wife
- **Pattern**: Tolerated alcoholism and cheating
- **Specific Example**: Drove 3 kids around to pick him up from pub
- **Family Response**: This tolerance was celebrated, establishing the model of a "good wife"
- **Impact**: Set the standard that women should manage and accommodate male misconduct

### Grandpa's Wife's Sister
- **Pattern**: Had a son climb off a balcony at age 2
- **Family Response**: The family validates her experience of it as an accident
- **Contrast**: This stands in stark contrast to how they approach Tia's similar accident
- **Impact**: Shows selective application of forgiveness based on insider status

### Grandpa's Son1's First Girlfriend (Nephew1's Mother)
- **Pattern**: Abandoned by Son1 with their baby
- **Later Pattern**: Got remarried to another DV perpetrator
- **Family Response**: Expected to tolerate this until Tia told her DV is not okay
- **Impact**: Women expected to endure multiple abusive relationships

### Person A (Tammy)
- **Pattern**: Sexually assaulted as a child by her grandfather
- **Her Response**: Did not question or confront her grandfather
- **Family Response**: No indication the grandfather faced consequences
- **Impact**: Established that even sexual assault of female family members should be tolerated

## 3. Examples of Outsider Scapegoating

### Tia (Nephew1's Ex)
- **Professional Background**: Worked with victims, speaks out against DV and CSA
- **Values**: Advocates for integrity, truth, non-violence
- **Threat to System**: These values directly challenged family norms
- **Pre-Tragedy Scapegoating**: Family banned her and their grandchildren from Christmas before the drowning
- **Post-Tragedy Scapegoating**: Blamed for child's accidental death, accused of "revenge murder"
- **Impact**: Perfect example of how the family treats women who challenge their system

### The Contrasting Treatment of Two Accidents

| Aspect | Grandpa's Wife's Sister's Case | Tia's Case |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------|
| Incident | Child climbed off balcony at age 2 | Child drowned in bath |
| Family Status | Blood relative, insider | Non-blood relative, outsider |
| Prior Stance on Family Norms | Compliant | Challenged abuse |
| Family's Interpretation | "Accident" | "Murder" |
| Evidence Required | None needed | Impossibly high standard |
| Family Support | Present | Absent (actually hostile) |

This contrast perfectly demonstrates how identical incidents are interpreted completely differently based solely on the person's status within the family system and their compliance with family norms.

## 4. The "Christmas Ban" as Pre-Emptive Scapegoating

The family's decision to ban Tia and her children from Christmas prior to the drowning incident is a critical piece of evidence that reveals the pre-existing scapegoat dynamic:

### Timeline Significance
- The ban occurred **before** any tragedy
- This proves Tia was already designated as "the problem"
- It wasn't a response to her actions but to her identity as a system challenger

### Psychological Purpose of Pre-Emptive Exclusion
- Isolates the target before crisis
- Makes it easier to blame them when a crisis occurs
- Prevents them from building alliances within the family
- Signals to other family members who the "approved" scapegoat is

### Contextual Meaning
- In family systems theory, this is called "triangulation" and "boundary creation"
- The family was closing ranks against Tia before any incident occurred
- This provided the foundation for the later false narrative

## 5. Tammy's Role as Narrative Creator

### Tammy's Position in the Family System
- Sexually abused by grandfather without consequences
- Sister to a convicted serial killer she believes is "innocent"
- Deeply invested in the family narrative that protects male violence

### Tammy's False "90-Minute" Report
- Created a completely fabricated timeframe (90 minutes vs. the actual 1-2 minutes)
- This fabrication matched the family's need to vilify Tia
- Once documented, it gained the appearance of authority

### Tammy's Psychological Motivation
- By accusing Tia, Tammy:
  - Diverts attention from her brother's crimes
  - Maintains her denial about family violence
  - Upholds the family system that protects males
  - Projects her own unresolved trauma onto an outsider
  - Preserves her identity as a "good woman" who doesn't challenge family

## Conclusion: The Pattern Repeats

This family demonstrates a remarkably consistent pattern across at least four generations:

1. Male violence is tolerated, minimized, or denied
2. Women are expected to absorb abuse without complaint
3. Women who challenge this system are isolated and scapegoated

The false accusation against Tia is not an isolated incident but the predictable outcome of a long-established family dynamic. Understanding this dynamic is essential to recognizing why the "revenge murder" claim persists despite its complete lack of evidence and statistical implausibility.

This pattern analysis demonstrates that the lens through which Tia's case has been viewed is not based on evidence but on deeply entrenched family dynamics that pre-date the tragic accident and would have colored the interpretation of any incident involving Tia.
