### 1  Brief of Instruction

I am asked to give an expert opinion on **whether Ms Tia intentionally harmed her daughter, Lily, on 25 July 2022 as an act of “spousal revenge” against Lily’s father, Mr AE
### 2  Material Considered

| Item                                                                                                   | Date             | Content                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Photograph of Ms Tia reading *Hold Me Tight: Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love* (Sue Johnson) | **24 July 2022** | Image clearly depicts The Book and indicates Ms Tia wanting to engage with the text.             |
| Chronology of Lily’s accidental injury                                                                 | **25 July 2022** | Uncontested timeline describes an accident in domestic setting. |
| No police, medical or prior-threat documentation supplied.                                             |                  |                                                                 |

### 3  Relevant Empirical & Theoretical Framework

1. **Filicide typologies.** Resnick’s classic schema (1969) and subsequent reviews identify five parental motives; “**spousal revenge**” filicide is the *rarest* (≈2 % of maternal cases). ([SpringerLink][1])
2. **Gendered prevalence.** Contemporary meta-analyses show 98 % of revenge-motivated familicide perpetrators are male. ([SpringerLink][1])
3. **Protective role of reflective parenting.** High **parental reflective functioning (PRF)** and deliberate study of attachment material correlate with lower maltreatment risk and more secure child outcomes. ([Frontiers][2], [MDPI][3])
4. **Attachment-based couple work.** *Hold Me Tight* is an evidence-based EFT manual aimed at strengthening adult attachment bonds, not harming partners. Engagement with such material predicts increased empathy and conflict-resolution skills. ([Explore That Book][4])

### 4  Analysis

| Issue                              | Observations                                                                              | Forensic Significance                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intent indicators**              | No threats, coercive-control behaviours or revenge statements reported.                   | Revenge filicide cases virtually always feature pre-incident threats or escalating IPV; their absence weighs heavily *against* a retaliatory motive. |
| **Behaviour 24 h before accident** | Documented reading of *Hold Me Tight*, a guide to *repair* couple bonds.                  | Consistent with prosocial, conciliatory intent; inconsistent with intent to punish partner via child harm.                                           |
| **Statistical base-rate**          | Maternal revenge filicide ≈ 2 %; male-perpetrated cases predominate.                      | Extremely low prior probability makes the hypothesis inherently unlikely.                                                                            |
| **Protective factors**             | Engagement with attachment literature; evidence of reflective functioning.                | Empirically linked to reduced maltreatment risk.                                                                                                     |
| **Alternative explanations**       | Accidental household injury is common and far more frequent than intentional infant harm. | Offers a parsimonious, evidence-consistent account of Lily’s injury.                                                                                 |

### 5  Opinion

Applying the civil standard of **balance of probabilities**—and noting that criminal courts require proof **beyond reasonable doubt**—**there is no credible psychological or empirical basis to assert that Ms Tia harmed Lily as an act of revenge.**

* Her documented conduct on **24 July 2022** reflects a deliberate effort to *strengthen* relational bonds, diametrically opposed to revenge motives.
* The alleged motive is **statistically extraordinary**, occurring in roughly one out of fifty maternal filicide cases, and typically involves antecedent threats or IPV evidence not present here.
* Protective factors (high PRF, active help-seeking via attachment literature) further **lower the already-remote probability** of retaliatory intent.

Accordingly, **it is my professional opinion that Ms Tia was exceedingly unlikely—approaching impossible on the evidence provided—to have injured Baby Lily as a punitive act against Mr Adam.**

### 6  Limitations

This opinion is confined to the materials supplied. Should additional evidence (e.g., medical records, police reports, collateral interviews) emerge, I am willing to review and, if necessary, amend my conclusions.

### 7  Expert Declaration

I confirm that I have complied with the Expert Witness Code of Conduct (WA) and that this report represents my independent, impartial opinion.
