## Summary of Facts and Chronology

Tia was living with her infant child and partner. On the day in question, the child was last seen alive under Tia’s care. Later, the child was found unresponsive in the bathroom. Emergency services were called immediately. In the initial investigation, authorities explored the possibility of homicide but ultimately found **no evidence of intentional harm or criminal action** by Tia. Instead, the charge brought against Tia was under the Western Australian **Children and Community Services Act 2004**, Section 101 – the offence of *failing to protect a child from harm*. The prosecution has relied heavily on speculative forensic theories (e.g. that the child’s hair was “dry” or the bath was empty) to dispute Tia’s account of events. The defence contests those theories and will show that (1) the timeline evidence is scientifically unsound and (2) Tia’s actions were reasonable under the circumstances, not criminal. Witness statements and affidavits from family describe Tia as a dedicated, caring mother who was traumatized by the child’s collapse; Tia has consistently maintained that the child’s death was a tragic accident. No witness or evidence links Tia to causing harm; the charge rests solely on speculative inferences from the scene.

## Refutation of Timeline/Forensic Theories

The prosecution’s timeline theories – such as inferring guilt from an *“empty bath”* or a child’s *“dry hair”* – are contradicted by forensic science. Forensic experts emphasize that drowning cases are “diagnoses of exclusion” and require careful investigation. Simply finding an empty bathtub is not proof of absence of water at the time of the incident. For example, first responders often **turn off faucets and drain tubs** when they find a victim, and these changes may not be documented. Investigators look for indirect signs of a wet scene (water lines, wet clothing, etc.) to reconstruct events. In this case, any water in the bath could have been drained when the child was discovered; the mere fact that the tub was empty does not contradict drowning. Similarly, a victim’s *dry hair* does **not** reliably indicate the time or cause of death. Medical literature notes that **hair and skin can be wet, damp, or dry depending on elapsed time** since submersion. In short, the scene here could easily have been altered by routine efforts to assist the child, and normal post-mortem changes can explain a lack of moisture. Importantly, as one forensic pathologist has written, even **factual experts disagree**: in a study of child deaths, some examiners called identical cases accidents while others called them homicides. The difference often boils down to subtle interpretations (“whether the victim **drowned or was drowned**”) rather than any clear physical evidence. Here, there are *no* definitive signs of foul play (no injuries, no confirmed asphyxia beyond water exposure). The forensic “dry hair/empty bath” theory is speculative and scientifically unreliable. Visual evidence underscores that water-related accidents are commonplace: even a child’s **five-gallon bucket** poses a drowning hazard.  *Figure: U.S. CPSC safety poster warning that even small containers of water (e.g. a 5‑gallon bucket) pose a drowning risk to young children. This underscores that tragic accidents can happen around ordinary water sources without foul play.* In summary, the prosecution’s timeline is undermined by known forensic uncertainties. Tia’s account of a sudden accident is entirely plausible and consistent with scientific understanding of drowning incidents.

## Applicable Law: Duty to Protect in Western Australia

Under WA law, criminal liability for “failure to protect” requires proof that the accused *had care or control of the child* and *knowingly or recklessly engaged in conduct leading to harm*. Section 101 of the Children and Community Services Act 2004 (WA) states: “A person who has the care or control of a child and who engages in conduct— (a) knowing that the conduct may result in the child suffering harm … or (b) reckless as to whether the conduct may have that result, is guilty of a crime and is liable to imprisonment for 10 years”. Thus **two elements** must be established: (1) Tia had care of the child (undisputed), and (2) she *willfully or recklessly* did something causing the child’s harm. Mere *omission* (failure to act) can suffice, but only if it is a conscious choice against knowledge of risk. Case law and commentary confirm the legislature’s intent: parents/caregivers must take positive steps to **protect children from known abuse or neglect**, not that they are criminally responsible for all accidents. The ALRC notes that the WA offence penalises only “knowing (or recklessly disregarding)” conduct likely to cause serious harm. By contrast, ordinary accidents or inadvertence do not meet this threshold. In Tia’s case, there is **no evidence** she was aware of any danger to the child, let alone risked it intentionally. The only question is whether failing to foresee this accident (with no warning signs or suspicious circumstances) can be punished. The defence submits it cannot: Section 101 was meant to target conscious choices that endangered children (for example, knowingly leaving an infant in a violent household). Tia’s immediate reaction was to try to save the child (calling for help), not to ignore or conceal the harm. Accordingly, on the evidence, the statutory elements are not met.

## Forensic Psychological Considerations: Trauma, Bias and Cognition

It is well-documented in psychological literature that a parent who suddenly discovers a child drowning can suffer *acute traumatic stress*, which impairs memory and perception. The DSM-5 recognizes **Acute Stress Disorder** as occurring within days of witnessing a life-threatening event (such as one’s child drowning). Symptoms include dissociative amnesia (inability to recall key aspects of the event) and intrusion or flashbacks, reflecting *fragmented memory* rather than deceit. In plain terms, Tia may recall the terrifying core of finding her baby but be unable to reconstruct every timeline detail. Forensic psychologists note that stress “tunnel-vision” can focus a parent on the emergency (rescue and call-for-help) rather than on procedural details of the scene. The defence will present evidence (and expert testimony if needed) that maternal trauma can cause exactly such memory gaps or confusion. Additionally, an evaluator guided by the APA’s forensic psychology standards would account for **contextual bias**. The “Specialty Guidelines” emphasize that forensic assessments must be **non-partisan** and culturally informed. One example of unconscious bias is *confirmation bias*: an authority may latch onto a theory (like “mum did it”) and overweight any detail that seems to fit. Studies confirm that even seasoned medical examiners disagree on manner-of-death when the victim is a child. A well-known survey found identical autopsy scenarios yielded accidents for some examiners and homicides for others, depending on subtle narrative frames. This underscores that forensic conclusions are not infallible; personal preconceptions and social attitudes (“mothers should always protect children”) can color judgment. The defence urges the Court to consider these psychological factors: Tia’s behavior (shocked, distressed, cooperative) is consistent with a mother in crisis, not a culprit. Any “gaps” in her memory are explainable by acute trauma. Indeed, the APA Guidelines remind experts to recognize their own potential biases and to weight all evidence carefully. In sum, psychological science supports Tia’s innocence: a traumatized mother can appear disoriented without that implying guilt, and investigations should not reflexively punish mental state distortions caused by stress.

## Character Evidence and Family Testimony

Affidavits from Tia’s relatives, friends, and the family social worker uniformly describe her as a responsible, affectionate mother. They note that Tia had no history of neglect or violence; on the contrary, she took child safety courses and insisted on careful bathing routines. Neighbors and family testify that Tia was *panicked and grief-stricken* when the child was found – behavior fully consistent with a mother’s horror, not with someone covering up wrongdoing. Psychologically, a mother’s instinctive reaction to a sudden emergency is to call for help immediately. Tia’s prompt call to emergency services and her candor with investigators align with innocence. By contrast, had Tia harmed the child, one would expect hesitation, deception, or concealment – none of which occurred. The defence will highlight that Tia’s constant cooperation and open shock provide strong counter-evidence to any notion of malfeasance. The family’s support, including a detailed timeline they provide of who was where and when, bolsters Tia’s account. All character evidence points in one direction: this was a family tragedy, not a crime.

## Precedents on Miscarriages of Justice

The Court should be mindful of history when evaluating this prosecution. Notorious cases show how *systemic bias and faulty forensics* can convict innocent mothers. In **Chamberlain (1980)**, Lindy Chamberlain was vilified and convicted of murdering her infant Azaria despite her credible report of a dingo attack; prosecutors and media scorned her story even though the official inquest initially accepted it. It took a public campaign and new evidence years later to reverse that miscarriage. Similarly, in the UK **Sally Clark** case (1999–2003), a mother was wrongly convicted of killing two babies largely on the basis of flawed “statistics” and misinterpreted pathology. The expert witness claimed the chance of two natural infant deaths was 1 in 73 million. That figure was later debunked as grossly misleading, and suppressed evidence showed one death had natural causes. Clark’s conviction was quashed, but only after she spent years in prison and never recovered. Likewise, **Angela Cannings** (2002–2003) was imprisoned for allegedly smothering two infants on equally dubious expert evidence by Professor Meadow; her conviction was overturned when Meadow’s testimony was discredited. In all these cases, respected courts eventually acknowledged that *“expert” assumptions can be wrong* and that *confirmation bias* (the tendency to see only evidence that fits a theory) can devastate justice. Recent scholarship (and even mainstream media) warn that medical examiners can disagree sharply on child deaths. The parallels with Tia’s case are clear: a mother under intense public scrutiny, a death with ambiguous forensic signs, and a rush to judgment based on presumption rather than proof. These precedents counsel caution. They demonstrate that the system too often punishes mothers on the basis of emotion-driven assumptions and “junk” forensic conclusions rather than solid facts. The defence asks the jury to learn from those errors: insist on genuine evidence of intent or recklessness before condemning a grieving mother.

## Conclusion

For all the above reasons, the evidence does not support a verdict of guilt. Tia had no intention of harming her child, and her conduct (as verified by psychology and character evidence) was consistent with a distraught mother, not a criminal. The supposed forensic “proof” is unreliable: experts recognize that drowning victims may be moved or that hair can dry post-mortem. Western Australian law imposes criminal liability only when a carer *knowingly or recklessly* causes harm – a threshold far beyond an unfortunate accident. Tia’s case, like Chamberlain’s, Clark’s, and Cannings’, involves tragic death and questionable interpretation of evidence. Justice demands that we not compound tragedy with wrongful conviction. The defence submits that a verdict of **not guilty** is required in the interests of truth and equity.

**Sources:** Authority and academic commentary have been cited throughout (WA statutes; forensic pathology literature; psychological guidelines; wrongful-conviction precedents). Each source supports the defence’s contention that Tia is innocent and that the prosecution’s case rests on unsound reasoning.
