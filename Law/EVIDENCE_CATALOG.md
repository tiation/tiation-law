### Prosecution Evidence Requiring Rebuttal

   - **Defense Rebuttal:** Completely contradicted by 000 call timestamp, paramedic records, and police investigation
   - **Underlying Issue:** Family dynamics and scapegoating behavior

## Evidence Gaps and Recommendations
1. **Expert testimony** needed on water evaporation and drainage rates
2. **Character witnesses** needed to testify to Ms. Jeffery's parenting history
3. **Bath manufacturer specifications** may help establish drainage rate
4. **Photos of Joshua's room** from toilet perspective would strengthen line-of-sight argument
5. **Photos of the bathroom step** to demonstrate how it could have provided unexpected access
6. **Original photos of the "Hold Me Tight" book** with metadata showing July 24, 2022 date
