## Evidence Strength Classification

### High-Strength Evidence
- Clear, direct expressions with unambiguous meaning
- Consistent patterns repeated over extended timeframes
- Multiple corroborating instances or related communications
- Strong contextual support for interpretation

### Medium-Strength Evidence
- Moderately clear expressions with generally consistent interpretation
- Patterns observed with some consistency
- Some corroborating instances or related communications
- Adequate contextual support for interpretation

### Low-Strength Evidence
- Indirect or ambiguous expressions requiring contextual interpretation
- Isolated instances without clear pattern establishment
- Limited corroborating instances or related communications
- Contextual factors that may support multiple interpretations
