# The Sate v Tia Astor

I do not want to be alive. Every day I wake up wishing I am dead. I consider suicide unethical. I want the chance to be with my baby again. Death is the only place that is a possibility. So I told myself, if you:

1. eradicate poverty
2. solve all violence
3. Change our justice system from retribution and deterence to restoration and prevention.
4. Change our entire human system from the ground up from toxic copetitiveness, to attachment and connection.

Then I may die.

Martin Luther King Jr. urged us to convert suffering into a “creative force.”  Let the energy that once powered accusation now illuminate prevention—first-aid courses in every mothers’ group, smart gates on every verandah, men’s circles that transmute anger into accountability.  In that redirected current, Lily’s story can bend toward helping hands rather than pointing fingers.

Buckminster Fuller reminded designers to “dare to be naive”—to imagine systems so well-fitted that ordinary lapses no longer lead to catastrophe.  Picture bathrooms with auto-drain sensors that trigger audible alerts, door-handles that log entry times, neighbourhood apps that open gates for first responders.  These are not fantasies; they are blueprints waiting for collective will.

And so the arc, the equation, and the dome carry us beyond exoneration to responsibility.  The law has spoken: **Not Guilty.**  Now society must answer the larger question: **What next?**  If we choose empathy over entropy, design over denial, then my daughter's silent witness will echo in lives saved, hearts educated, and families spared the long night this one has endured.

May that be the legacy that outlives these pages—a testament that justice, once done, can seed a kinder architecture for all.
