Legend:
[T] = Toilet position         → = Movement path
[D] = Doorway                 ↑ = Movement direction
[X] = Starting position       --- = Wall/barrier
[TUB] = Bathtub position
```

## 2. Movement Time Analysis
```
Segment Timeline:
|-------------------- 60 SECONDS TOTAL --------------------|

[====== Toilet Use (30s) ======][Move][Find][Action]
                                └─7.2s┘└5-7s┘└15-20s┘

Breakdown:
00:00 - 00:30 : Toilet use (minimum physiological time)
00:30 - 00:37 : Movement (7.2 seconds at 1.4 m/s)
00:37 - 00:44 : Search and find
00:44 - 01:00 : Emergency action

Maximum possible times:
* Movement: 10.1m ÷ 1.4m/s = 7.2 seconds
* Total activity: 52.2 seconds
```

## 3. Sight Lines Analysis

## 5. Proof Summary

```
ONE MINUTE TIMELINE PROOF:

[30 seconds minimum]  [7.2 seconds]   [22.8 seconds remaining]
|-----------------|  |-----------|   |---------------------|
     Toilet use    →  Movement   →   Discovery & Response
     (proven by      (proven by      (proven by medical
      medical         physics &       response time &
      evidence)      measured         emergency call)
                    distances)

TOTAL TIME: 60 SECONDS
```

## 6. Physical Constraints

```
Key Physical Limitations:

1. DISTANCE: 10.1m total
   |---1.5m---|---1.6m---|------5.2m------|--1.8m--|
   (toilet)    (to room)   (to bathroom)    (to tub)

2. SPEED: 1.4 m/s maximum walking speed
   Cannot physically move faster through space

3. SIGHT LINES: No visual contact possible
   [Toilet] ╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳╳ [Bathroom]
            (walls block view)

4. MINIMUM TIMES:
   Toilet use: 30s (physiological minimum)
   Movement: 7.2s (physics-based minimum)
   Response: 15-20s (documented minimum)
```

## 7. Timeline Verification Points

```
Fixed Time Anchors:

7:36:15 AM    7:37:15 AM    7:40:00 AM
    |             |             |
    v             v             v
  Start      Discovery       000 Call
    |             |             |
    |<---1 min--->|             |
    |<-------- 3:45 total ------>|

PROOF: Working backward from 7:40:00 AM call
confirms one-minute supervision window

*This diagram provides visual proof that Ms. Jeffery's supervision lapse was approximately one minute. The physical layout, measured distances, and movement times make a longer timeline impossible.*
